### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Adele Laurie Blue Adkins

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary homes: Beverly Hills (main), Kensington townhouse kept for UK family visits
- Regular commute: Los Angeles ⇄ Las Vegas (weekend residency); annual six-week London stay each summer
- Avoids long tour grinds; prefers “hub-and-spoke” travel with direct return to son in L.A.

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Singer-songwriter; 17× Grammy Award winner, Oscar for “Skyfall,” global album sales >140 M
- Extends “Weekends with Adele” Vegas residency through March 2026; consistently sold out
- Minority partner, Melted Stone Records—her imprint now scouting soul/R&B newcomers

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- In studio crafting fifth album (working title: “32”) for late-2026 release; sonic theme: “gravity vs. weightlessness of love”—she is literally testing vocals in reduced-oxygen chambers for texture research
- Building a female-led songwriting camp in the Cotswolds; first retreat slated Q4 2025
- Deepening philanthropic focus on maternal mental health and music-therapy access for adolescents

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate amateur chef—obsessed with mastering zero-waste recipes; travels with custom spice kit
- Sunday Premier League rituals; lifelong Tottenham Hotspur supporter (“Come On You Spurs” tattoo on ankle)
- Night-owl reader of lay-astronomy classics; favors Carl Sagan’s “pale blue dot” framing—sees lunar trip as literal embodiment of that perspective
- Guiding mantra: “If it isn’t raw and honest, it isn’t worth the breath”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Iconic voice + authenticity aligns with Planta’s mission to humanize frontier tech; planned 15-minute acoustic set inside observation dome (no back-track, only lunar reverberation)
- Curious about low-gravity acoustics and whether lunar dust alters sound diffusion—wants a quick briefing from onsite engineers
- Intends to workshop a short spoken-word piece on interplanetary homesickness for post-event documentary
- Seeks informal chats on mental-health support protocols for future space travelers—potential partnership with ESA psychologists

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable intros: NASA acoustics lead Dr. Lena Chow; Chef José Andrés (space-adapted cuisine); venture funds backing music-therapy tech (e.g., Ableton Impact)
- Attendees can help by sharing sensory-design data or immersive-audio prototypes usable in her next world-tour staging
- Engage her with candid, witty banter; ask about roast-potato techniques or Spurs’ latest signing before pivoting to lunar topics

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Fiercely protective of son Angelo’s privacy—no family questions
- Vocal cords sensitive to dry air; confirm humidifier availability in lunar habitat
- Surprise-fact prompt: she crafts furniture in her garage; recently completed a walnut rocking chair—lever to discuss micro-gravity carpentry
- Future deep-dive: whether she’d license a lunar-recorded track to Planta’s metaverse platform (exclusive drop could fund her mental-health initiative)
