### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Kim Nam-joon (stage name: RM)

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Hannam-dong, Seoul
- Maintains pied-à-terre near MoMA PS1, Queens, for art deep-dives
- Routinely triangulates Seoul ↔ Tokyo ↔ Los Angeles every six weeks; uses flights to write lyrics uninterrupted

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Leader & main songwriter, BTS; shareholder and creative board advisor, HYBE Corp.
- Solo artist: “Indigo” (2022) certified Platinum; follow-up LP slated Q4 2025
- Driver behind HYBE’s Web3 fan-engagement stack and virtual concert IP

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing bilingual album weaving Korean poetic forms with ambient synth pop; collaborators include Jonny Greenwood & Peggy Gou
- Spearheading HYBE’s “Phonosphere” project—immersive concerts rendered simultaneously in VR headsets and low-latency LEO satellite streams
- Personally curating 2026 Guggenheim exhibition on sound-into-space art; negotiating loan of Nam June Paik’s “Moon Is the Oldest TV”
- Yearlong pledge to plant 100K mangrove trees across ASEAN; tying carbon credits to fan badge NFTs

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Self-taught art historian; owns early Lee Ufan sketches and a growing collection of Brutalist architectural models
- Keeps a field notebook of “moon words” from multiple languages—intends to publish as limited-edition chapbook
- Favorite maxim: “Presence is the rarest luxury” (scribbled on his in-ear monitors)
- Wind-down ritual: assembling 1:200 scale space-station LEGO sets while looping Debussy’s “Clair de Lune”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a living metaphor for transcending terrestrial fandom walls
- Wants to test Phonosphere’s latency by beaming a 30-second live rap from the lunar base to fans in Seoul—proof-of-concept for off-planet gigs
- Seeks dialog with regenerative-ag tech thinkers on how lunar hydroponics could inspire drought-proof food solutions on Earth
- Offers cultural cachet and massive storytelling reach (110 M+ social followers) to amplify Planta’s narrative

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intro desired: SpaceX Starlink engineering lead (edge computing for real-time uplink), chef Dominique Crenn (zero-waste haute cuisine)
- Likely to mentor indie artists curious about cross-reality performance rights
- Engage him by gifting a handwritten excerpt of Yi Sang’s “Crow’s Eye View” translated onto recycled mylar—aligns poetry, sustainability, and space

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers unhurried one-on-one chats over group schmoozing; best window is post-meal, walking the habitat corridor
- Sensitive topic: military service—completed in 2025, proud but keen to shift conversation forward
- Follow-up Qs: 1) Viability of low-gravity acoustic instruments for live sets 2) Interest in co-producing a lunar-recorded spoken-word EP benefitting UNESCO cultural heritage fund
