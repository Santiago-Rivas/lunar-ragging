### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Bruno Giussani

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Lugano, Switzerland  
- Secondary hubs: London & New York (TED offices)  
- Predictable travel rhythm: Vancouver (TED mainstage), Silicon Valley (board & fund meetings) every 8–10 weeks; embraces ultra-long-haul “thinking flights” with no Wi-Fi to outline new curation themes  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Global Curator & Chairman, TED Conferences; leads editorial vision for all TEDGlobal and satellite experiences  
- Co-founder, FIFTH (Future Insights for a Thriving Humanity) – a boutique advisory aligning philanthropists with moon-shot social ventures (quietly launched 2024)  
- Former columnist for The Economist & The New York Times; 2004 Knight Fellow at Stanford  
- Key achievements: grew TEDGlobal from 400 to 1,200+ attendees while expanding into Latin America & Africa; shepherded talks that amassed >4 B views (“Do Schools Kill Creativity?”, “The Danger of a Single Story”)  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Architecting TED’s 2026 “Planet B” series spotlighting off-Earth habitats & regenerative space economies  
- Closing a €35 M blended-finance vehicle inside FIFTH to back civic-tech tools defending democratic dialogue against deep-fakes  
- Writing a short book on “Curatorial Ethics in the Age of AI Speakers” (Penguin, late 2025)  
- Personal ambition: secure Italian-Swiss funding for a cultural residency aboard Axiom Station by 2028  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Avid alpine paraglider; claims altitude clears “curatorial clutter” better than meditation  
- Collects first-edition science-fiction paperbacks—leans on authors like Stanisław Lem for framing tech futures  
- Guiding philosophy: “Ideas are migratory birds—give them thermals, not cages.”  
- Unusual fact suitable for conversation prompt: distills his own small-batch vermouth from Ticino botanicals and supplies a clandestine TED backstage bar  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Thought-leadership bridge between Earth-based cultural institutions and nascent lunar society; ideal storyteller to capture the dinner’s narrative for global audiences  
- Seeking: First-hand sensory insights to inform TED “Planet B” programming; candid chatter on psychological design of off-world gatherings  
- Contribution: Can frame the 2027 moon dinner as a seminal “origin myth” for future civic rituals—offering platform amplification, speaker curation, and documentary resources  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros desired to: Space-architecture firm BIG-Lunar, ESA’s Human & Robotic Exploration Directorate, and Patagonia’s new Mars-grade materials lab  
- Helpful for him: access to Planta’s biometric social-feedback data (anonymized) for an upcoming TED AI+Society salon  
- Engagement tips: Present big ideas in headline form first—he mentally tags them for later deep dives; share a compelling book or art reference and he’ll open right up  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Quietly skeptical of hype-heavy “astro-tourism” models—prefers substantive cultural or scientific framing; avoid clichés about “giant leaps”  
- Soft spot for culinary experimentation—offer a swap between his vermouth and any moon-grown herb infusion  
- Follow-up question: What ethical guardrails should guide storytelling when Earth audiences can’t yet verify lunar experiences firsthand?
