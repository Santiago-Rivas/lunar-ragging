### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Bengaluru, India (Biocon Global HQ & philanthropic foundation offices)
- Regular circuits: Boston (Fidelity-Biocon JV), Geneva (WHO advisory sessions), Dubai/Singapore (family office & sovereign co-investment meetings)
- Accepts ≈10 high-impact speaking engagements per year; prefers red-eye flights to maximize India office overlap

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Executive Chairperson, Biocon Ltd. & Biocon Biologics (world’s largest emerging-markets biosimilars platform)
- Non-executive director, Infosys; founder, Mazumdar-Shaw Medical Center (1,400-bed oncology hub)
- Pioneered affordable insulin & trastuzumab; Fortune “Top 50 Businesswomen” for 15 consecutive years

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing $650 M capacity upgrade to triple biosimilar production ahead of 2026 U.S./EU launches
- Seed-funding an internal “Space-Omics” unit exploring microgravity-enhanced cell cultures for rare-disease biologics
- Personal push: deploy ₹10 B philanthropic capital toward AI-driven early cancer diagnostics in rural India
- Quietly evaluating alternative-protein ventures (precision fermentation & cell-based chicken) for synergy with Biocon’s bioprocess expertise

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Early career as India’s first woman brew-master—still designs craft IPA recipes in her home pilot brewery (“fermentation is universal biology”)
- Collects vintage botanical illustrations; cites J. C. Bose’s plant neurobiology work as proof that “life sciences need radical imagination”
- Morning routine includes 45-minute Kathakali-inspired dance cardio; believes disciplined art fuels scientific creativity

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a living lab for closed-loop bioreactors, sterile food production, and long-duration pharma stability
- Hoping to meet bio-astronautics researchers to validate protein folding data from ISS-20 payload
- Curious about Planta Network’s social-graph tech for distributing low-cost cancer-diagnostic kits via trust-based micro-communities
- Offers expertise on bioprocess scale-up, regulatory diplomacy, and price-parity models for frontier environments

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions: 
  • Dr. Yvonne Cagle (NASA space medicine)  
  • Axiom Station’s life-science payload team  
  • Temasek’s Agri-Food Fund (alt-protein Series B pipeline)
- Can mentor founders on navigating India’s CDSCO approvals; in return seeks advisory board spots for promising space-bio startups
- Engage her with data: bring one-pager summarizing lunar-gravity experiment design; schedule 15-minute VR demo of Planta’s social platform

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers concise, numbers-first dialogue; follows up personally if insights are crisp
- Sensitive topic: avoids public discussion of 2024 political donation controversy—steer conversation toward science, not policy
- Potential icebreaker for host question: “Most people don’t know I still run a secret nano-brewery in my garage—fermenting hops at 1/6th Earth’s gravity would be the ultimate experiment.”
