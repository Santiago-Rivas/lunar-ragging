### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Anshu Gupta

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: New Delhi, India; secondary base in Dehradun near Goonj’s circular-economy hub
- Regular circuits through Kathmandu, Dhaka, and Nairobi to seed “Cloth for Dignity” replication centers; quarterly visits to Europe for donor briefings

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Executive Director, Goonj (1999–present): re-engineered urban discard into rural development currency; 7,000+ partner villages
- 2015 Ramon Magsaysay Award; “India’s Clothing Man” profile in Economist & NatGeo
- Catalyst voice in Asia-Pacific Climate Adaptation Alliance; steers policy on disaster-relief logistics

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling “Greenway Labs” to convert lunar-analog regolith simulant and textile waste into insulation tiles—proof-of-concept ready by Q4 2026
- Piloting AI-driven supply-chain platform with Microsoft Philanthropies to cut relief delivery time by 40 %
- Personal goal: author a memoir-manifesto on “dignity-first design” before his 55th birthday (August 2027)
- Mentoring daughter’s ed-tech start-up that gamifies civic empathy for Gen Z schools

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend long-distance motorcyclist; completed Delhi-to-Spiti 1,100 km solo ride last summer—uses journeys to test low-bulk relief kits
- Fascinated by Jain philosophy of “aparigraha” (non-hoarding) and cites it when challenging consumerism in boardrooms
- Keeps an informal list of strange things donated to Goonj (top entry: a taxidermied peacock)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited as emblem of circular resource thinking for off-world habitats; eager to explore how waste streams on the Moon can seed social cohesion, not just engineering efficiency
- Seeks conversations with material scientists on mycelium-based fabrics and with XR designers on empathy-driven virtual volunteering
- Offers: 25 years of ground-up community mobilization frameworks to help Planta draft an “interplanetary social protocol” for inclusion

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: 
  • Dr. Yara Kim (JAXA lunar regolith composites)  
  • Jensen Ortega (Patagonia’s regenerative design fund)  
  • VR storyteller Nnedi Okoye for co-creating “Lunar Cloth Tales” experience
- Attendees can assist by providing micro-grant pathways for frontier social experiments and sharing transport manifests for up-cycled payloads
- Engaging angle: ask about the emotional currency he’s packing for the Moon—he carries a cloth rag from the 1999 Chamoli quake on every expedition

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive trigger: disdains token CSR talk; expects clear accountability metrics
- Prefers standing or walking conversations; lunar gravity novelty can be used to co-design a short “resource relay” icebreaker
- Follow-up: confirm his dietary needs—strictly vegetarian yet adventurous with plant-based lab cuisine
