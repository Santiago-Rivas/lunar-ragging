### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Ai Weiwei

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Montemor-o-Novo, Portugal (converted rural studio & farm)
- Maintains ateliers in Berlin and Brooklyn; rotates quarterly depending on exhibitions
- Annual “field research” loops through refugee corridors (Lesbos, Calais, US-Mexico border)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Multidisciplinary artist, architect, and activist; studios employ ~60 fabricators across three continents
- Landmark works: Sunflower Seeds (Tate Modern), Remembering (Munich), and design consult on Beijing’s “Bird’s Nest” stadium
- Influence zones: politically charged public art, documentary film, Web3 art provenance, cultural diplomacy

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Developing a lunar-themed immersive installation “Weight of Freedom” for 2028 Venice Biennale
- Producing NFT 2.0 series that ties on-chain ownership to real-time human rights datasets
- Quietly fundraising €20 M for “Floating Schools” in Mediterranean refugee camps
- Personal: perfecting ceramic techniques learned from Portuguese artisans; wants to merge ancient glazing with 3-D printing

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobbies: beekeeping on his Portuguese farm; uses honey as pigment binder in experimental paintings
- Maintains a daily habit of solving architecture puzzles in VR to “test spatial ethics under zero gravity”
- Guiding maxim: “Art is not an object; it’s the evidence that we existed and resisted.”
- Unexpected fact: was once an avid competitive table-tennis coach—keeps a collapsible paddle in his carry-on

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Planning lunar installation research; keen to sense physical and psychological dynamics of low-gravity dining
- Seeking: 
  ‑ Material data on regolith-based ceramics  
  ‑ Astronaut anecdotes on sensory perception shifts  
  ‑ Cross-disciplinary collaborators for a crowd-sourced “Lunar Memory Archive”
- Value offered: Will live-sketch concepts during dinner; later gifts limited-edition lithographs to attendees, driving post-event buzz

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Artemis habitat materials lead; SpaceX food systems engineer; Michelin-star chef Ana Roš (for edible art collab)
- Ways attendees can help: share personal migration or exile stories for his documentary scripts; provide access to private lunar surface imagery
- Engaging him: Ask how beekeeping informs space architecture or invite his insight on balancing dissent with optimism in frontier settings

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Avoid casual discussion of Chinese state surveillance; he responds but conversation can dominate
- Prefers candid, first-person narratives over abstract theory—truthful vulnerability earns trust
- Follow-up questions:  
  ‑ Status of EU funding application for “Floating Schools”  
  ‑ What acoustic properties is he testing for “Weight of Freedom” under low pressure environments
