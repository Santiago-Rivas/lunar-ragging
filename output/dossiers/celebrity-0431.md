### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Christiana Figueres

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: London (professional hub) & San José, Costa Rica (family, rainforest recharge)  
- Predictable travel rhythm: quarterly circuits through Washington D.C., Berlin, and Singapore for climate-finance boards; annual 10-day silent retreat in India

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-Founder, Global Optimism; Co-host, “Outrage + Optimism” podcast (3 M+ monthly listeners)  
- Former Executive Secretary, UNFCCC (2010-2016) and chief architect of the Paris Agreement  
- Senior adviser to UBS Sustainable Finance Council & Space4Climate consortium

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Steering “Regenerative LAC 2030,” a $1 B blended-finance platform accelerating nature-based carbon removal across Latin America  
- Finalizing book #2, “Beyond Earth, Same Home,” exploring ethical governance for off-world habitats (publishes Q4 2026)  
- Designing a VR curriculum for middle-schoolers that simulates closed-loop ecosystems—pilot rollout with UNICEF in 7 countries  
- Personal 2025–26 goal: obtain paragliding certification to highlight aerial climate monitoring

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Morning ritual: 45-minute Ashtanga practice; credits yoga for “stubborn optimism” mindset  
- Classical guitar enthusiast—keeps a travel-size instrument and plays pre-event to steady nerves  
- Guiding belief: “We are not powerless passengers on Spaceship Earth; we are the crew.”  
- Surprising fact she enjoys revealing: summited Kilimanjaro with her two daughters to place a Paris Agreement flag on the shrinking glacier

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to inject rigorous sustainability framing into lunar hospitality; her presence signals Planta’s intent to lead on off-world ESG standards  
- Actively seeking collaborators to draft a “Lunar Net-Zero Protocol” covering launch emissions, regolith mining, and waste loops  
- Will spotlight the opportunity for the space sector to leapfrog fossil dependency by adopting green hydrogen and solar-thermal propulsion from day one  
- Offers persuasive storytelling on how bold, joyful experiences (a dinner on the Moon) can accelerate public climate engagement

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: SpaceX Starshield life-support team; Breakthrough Energy Ventures’ space portfolio; Japanese lunar-solar power researchers  
- Attendees can contribute data on in-situ resource utilization or novel carbon credit frameworks for off-planet activities  
- Engagement tip: open with a question about parallels between Costa Rican cloud forests and lunar domes—then ask for her “one uncomfortable truth & one outrageous hope” for space sustainability

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive to superficial “greenwashing”; come prepared with transparent lifecycle numbers for the event’s logistics  
- Prefers concise, forward-looking dialogue—limit historical rehash of Paris Agreement  
- Potential follow-up: invite her to record a special “Outrage + Optimism” episode from the Sea of Tranquility habitat—she is already intrigued by the acoustics of lunar regolith walls
