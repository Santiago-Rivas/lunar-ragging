### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Natalie Portman

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: Los Angeles (Pacific Palisades) & Paris 17e; maintains a quiet writing retreat outside Tel Aviv
- Travel rhythm: 3–4 international flights per month for film shoots, UN Women engagements, and alt-protein board meetings; favors red-eye flights to preserve daytime parenting hours

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & Principal, MountainA Films—female-led production slate backed by Apple Studios
- Academy Award–winning actor (Black Swan) and director (A Tale of Love and Darkness); UN Women Goodwill Ambassador
- Early investor/advisor in Oatly, MycoWorks, Tender Food; quietly assembling a $75 M climate-storytelling fund

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Producing a limited series on Sylvia Earle’s ocean missions, slated for 2026 release
- Finalizing term sheet for “Project LunaFarm,” an R&D incubator for closed-loop regenerative agriculture in extreme environments (earth & off-planet)
- Completing a children’s picture book on empathy across species; publishing Q4 2025
- Personal: carving out six weeks each summer for immersive language study with her kids (Mandarin this year)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong vegetarian turned vocal vegan; cites Einstein’s “Nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival… as the evolution to a vegetarian diet”
- Keeps a tiny Leica M10 in her bag—shoots black-and-white candids on set to relax
- Loves cryptic crosswords; swaps clues with Steven Spielberg as a running joke
- “Surprising” fact she offers: has a pilot’s license for single-engine planes, earned incognito in 2023 to research aerial cinematography

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a proof-of-concept for lux-but-low-impact hospitality in space—directly relevant to Project LunaFarm
- Seeking dialogue on nutrient-dense mycelium proteins viable under lunar gravity; eager to tour Planta’s hydroponic stack if any VR mock-ups exist
- Offers star-power narrative framing: willing to host a short-form documentary segment on the event for her climate-storytelling fund

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: NASA’s Deep Space Food Lab, SpaceX life-support engineers, Alain Ducasse’s R&D team (sustainable haute cuisine)
- Can connect fellow guests to Closed Loop Partners and Hollywood Climate Summit investors
- Engagement tips: approach with a technical angle first (she loves data), then pivot to creative storytelling
- Ideal ice-breaker: ask about her Leica—she’ll likely offer to snap a zero-gravity portrait

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid personal questions about marriage; keeps family shielded from press
- Prefers venues with quiet corners for one-on-one depth; loud group banter drains her
- Follow-up question for post-event: would she consider executive-producing Planta’s branded short on lunar sustainability?
