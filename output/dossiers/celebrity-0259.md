### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS

- Believes elite sport is “90 % emotion management, 10 % mechanics”; meditates with 8-minute Wim Hof-style breathing pre-match
- Reads near-future sci-fi (N.K. Jemisin, Ann Leckie) to unwind—expects human habitation on Mars “within two Serena-length careers”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a live case study for extreme-environment performance and fan engagement beyond Earth
- Wants to explore: micro-gravity training effects on fast-twitch muscle recovery, and immersive VR stadium experiences for remote supporters

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Ideal introductions: 
  • Planta’s XR engineering lead (for VR match-viewing prototype)

  • Impact investors focused on youth mental-wellness tech
- Can offer: athlete ambassador role for lunar/space initiatives; willingness to beta-test new wearables during 2026 tour
- Best engagement tactic: open with design questions—she loves talking about ergonomic furniture and could segue into lunar habitat ergonomics

### ADDITIONAL NOTES

- Unusual fact she may share: secretly took evening classes in interior architecture; sketches spaceship cabin layouts for fun
- Follow-up probe: interest level in co-producing a short doc on “Kindness in Zero-G” with Planta’s content studio?
