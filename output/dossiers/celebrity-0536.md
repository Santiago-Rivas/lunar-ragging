### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Tyler Cowen

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Fairfax, Virginia (George Mason University campus & home studio)
- Near-weekly Amtrak shuttle to New York City for recording and restaurant exploration
- Annual “learning sprints” in Lagos, Bangalore, and Mexico City to scout talent for Emergent Ventures

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Holbert L. Harris Chair of Economics, GMU; co-founder, Marginal Revolution blog (4 M+ monthly readers)
- Host, “Conversations with Tyler” podcast; 300+ long-form interviews shaping elite discourse
- Founder, Emergent Ventures micro-grant fund—1,100+ grants, $90 M deployed toward “talent with outsized upside”

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling Emergent Ventures “Climate & Cosmos” track to seed lunar agriculture, closed-loop habitats, and asteroid-resource startups
- Drafting next book, “Competence Without Borders,” examining how geo-agnostic talent will reorganize economics in the age of AGI & off-world work
- Advising two stealth AI alignment labs; pushing for prediction-market integration in policy forecasting
- Personal goal: visit 25 new Michelin-listed restaurants before 2027 launch to refine sensorial frameworks for moon-based gastronomy

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong jazz piano enthusiast; currently perfecting Thelonious Monk’s “Round Midnight” to test how micro-gravity changes finger attack
- Collects obscure medieval cookbooks—fascinated by how scarcity shaped flavor; expects lunar scarcity to spur similar culinary creativity
- Guiding maxim: “Talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not—so build the bridge.”
- Little-known fact: Has an amateur radio license and enjoys bouncing signals off the ionosphere—keen to try the same off the lunar surface

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Economics of extraterrestrial social spaces; can articulate how novel environments spark agglomeration effects and cultural export markets
- Looking to meet: Materials scientists and sensory psychologists studying taste perception in low gravity; founders designing crypto-native property regimes for space
- Value offered: Real-time economic frameworks, media amplification through Marginal Revolution, and fast-track Emergent Ventures funding for promising lunar-tech concepts

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Dr. Jessica Watkins (NASA geologist) for lunar habitat insights  
  • Balaji Srinivasan (Network State) on decentralized governance  
  • Dan Barber (Blue Hill) for regenerative food systems cross-pollination
- Ideal engagement: Invite him to a small “economics of awe” round-table—10 min lightning talks followed by open-ended Q&A; he thrives on rapid data exchange
- Provide annotated tasting notes of the lunar menu; he will likely blog and podcast about the gastronomic experiment, expanding event reach

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers concrete numbers over visionary rhetoric; come armed with one striking data point
- Politely intolerant of long PowerPoint decks—suggest walk-and-talk tour of the hydroponic farm instead
- Follow-up question aligned with host prompt: “What’s a surprising non-economic project you’re secretly funding right now?” (Expect answer about commissioning algorithm-generated sacred music.)
