### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Kevin De Bruyne

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Cheshire, UK (short drive to Manchester City’s Etihad Campus)
- Maintains family residence in Drongen, Belgium; frequent shuttles between UK–Belgium during international breaks
- Off-season pattern: two-week alpine retreat in Switzerland for altitude conditioning; winter micro-stints in Dubai for warm-weather recovery

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Club Captain & Advanced Playmaker, Manchester City FC; contract through June 2027 with a hybrid player-coach clause effective 2026
- Record holder for most Premier League assists by a non-English player; four-time Premier League champion, 2023 UEFA Champions League winner
- Minority investor, ElevenLabs Sport Analytics (real-time biomechanical tracking for elite teams)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Targeting peak fitness for Belgium’s 2026 North American World Cup campaign—likely last major tournament before formal transition to coaching
- Building a data-driven “De Bruyne Method” curriculum focused on cognitive speed and spatial awareness for grassroots academies
- Expanding family foundation’s work on inclusive playgrounds using recycled turf composites
- Personal curiosity: long-duration human performance in reduced-gravity environments—exploring partnerships with ESA’s sports physiology unit

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur oenologist; keeps a 400-bottle climate-controlled cellar but avoids alcohol during season—enjoys aroma profiling more than drinking
- Hands-on coder (self-taught Python) for custom xG and passing-lane models; sees parallels between football geometry and orbital mechanics
- Guiding maxim: “Vision is earned in silence”—dedicates 30 minutes daily to sensory-deprivation meditation pods
- Little-known hobby: builds mechanical Lego replicas of iconic stadiums to relax with his two sons

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attracted by the symbolic leap from terrestrial pitch to lunar social space—keen to discuss how micro-gravity could redefine agility drills
- Seeking dialogue on immersive fan experiences that blend AR, haptics, and real-time stats for global audiences unable to attend matches live
- Offers unique perspective on leadership under pressure and split-second decision-making that could inform Planta’s social-interaction algorithms

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: ESA’s Human Performance team; founders of Zero-G Sports Lab; venture partners investing in fan engagement tech
- Could mentor early-stage startups translating elite-sport cognitive training to education or workforce productivity
- Engage him with tactile, experiential demos (e.g., light-speed reaction walls) rather than slide decks; humor about “space assists” will land well

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers concise, sincere conversation—detests celebrity gossip; safeguard privacy around his wife and three children
- Unusual fact prompt: Mention his near-professional youth career in competitive cycling before choosing football—opens door to cross-sport innovation talk
- Follow-up query: interest level in piloting a Moon-based “gravity-reduced skills camp” video series post-2027 retirement
