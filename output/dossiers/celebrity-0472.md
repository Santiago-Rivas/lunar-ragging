### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Sir Jonathan Paul “Jony” Ive  

---

### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: San Francisco Peninsula (LoveFrom studio in Redwood City); secondary residence in London’s Holland Park  
- Regular shuttles to Maranello (Ferrari partnership) and Tokyo (materials research)  
- Prefers discreet, small-footprint travel—charters a Gulfstream G550 kept carbon-offset through Climeworks program  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder, LoveFrom – boutique creative collective shaping industrial design, brand systems, and “quiet tech” interfaces  
- Former Chief Design Officer, Apple; led iMac, iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple Park campus design language  
- Design advisor to Ferrari, Airbnb, Moncler; Chancellor of the Royal College of Art  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing Ferrari’s first fully electric GT interior, targeting 2027 launch  
- Incubating a micro-scale satellite project with Astra for “design-first” orbital sensing devices  
- LoveFrom Materials Lab experimenting with mycelium-based composites for high-stress structural parts  
- Personal: mentoring under-represented RCA fellows; writing a slim volume on “The Poetry of Use” slated for limited private release Q4 2026  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects vintage fountain pens; sketches every morning before e-mail—asks others what tools they use to think  
- Fascinated by choral architecture: believes spaces “must sing to be heard”  
- Weekend passion: hand-restoring a 1959 Jaguar XK150 in an all-white garage—calls it “therapy through proportion”  
- Guiding axiom: “Essentialism is not minimalism; it’s respect for attention.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar dinner aligns with his exploration of design in low-gravity habitats and multi-sensory dining rituals  
- Keen to discuss: material tactility with gloved hands, acoustics in pressurized domes, and non-visual cues for social warmth when faces are behind visors  
- Seeking collaborators who can provide: bio-based polymers tolerant to lunar radiation, culinary scientists testing flavor perception in 1/6 g  
- Offers: concept sketches for modular, pack-flat furnishings; stewardship on creating an iconic lunar visual identity  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable introductions: SpaceX Starship cabin ergonomics team; ESA Human Factors division; Chef Heston Blumenthal (space food texture pioneer)  
- Attendees can help by sharing real-world data on dust mitigation and thermal cycling of soft goods  
- Engage him with tangible prototypes he can handle; invite him to critique object narratives, not just form—he lights up when discussing the “why” behind curves  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid deep Apple retrospectives; he politely deflects and the conversation stalls  
- Prefers calm, low-light settings—harsh LEDs undermine his focus  
- Possible “unusual fact” prompt: he composes minimalist choral pieces under a pseudonym; has three works registered with PRS yet never publicly performed  
- Follow-up question worth exploring: What does “nostalgia for the future” mean in the context of lunar living?
