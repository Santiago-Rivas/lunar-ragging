### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Abdallah Abouelenein

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Dubai → Abu Dhabi tech corridor (actually keeps a studio apartment in both for rapid access to DIFC investors and Masdar City R&D labs)  
- Monthly rotation between Houston (NASA & Axiom partners), Munich (ESA incubator), and Nairobi (vertical-farm pilot)  
- Routinely schedules “digital sabbaticals” on Red Sea dive boats—48 hrs off-grid to synthesize ideas

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Executive Chair, LUNARISTA Foods Inc.—orbital-hydroponic systems producing micro-greens for space habitats  
- General Partner, Oasis Frontier Ventures (US $350 M fund targeting off-Earth logistics, in-situ resource utilization, and climate-resilient ag-tech)  
- Architect of the first private MoU with the UAE Space Agency for bio-regenerative life-support trials on the Gateway station (launch window 2028)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a US $75 M Series B to scale “MoonBloom” nutrient-film modules; goal: 40 % reduction in resupply mass for Artemis IV missions  
- Negotiating exclusive rights to test basalt-derived growth substrates with JAXA’s SLIM 2 lander payload  
- Personal ambition: complete commercial astronaut training at Axiom by Q4 2026—wants to be “chief taste-tester” of his own lunar basil  
- Writing a short manifesto on “Food Sovereignty Beyond Earth,” targeting Nature Astronomy op-ed in early 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Classical oud player; composes micro-tonal pieces inspired by telemetry data—claims it improves pattern-recognition for system anomalies  
- Devotee of Stoic philosophy; quotes Epictetus: “First say to yourself what you would be, then do what you have to do.”  
- Collects 1960s Soviet space-program propaganda posters—believes the aesthetic “keeps the team hungry” for bold milestones

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar Dinner offers live testbed for LUNARISTA’s flavor profile studies in 1/6 g; seeking guest feedback on texture perception under altered gravity  
- Eager to meet chefs experimenting with lab-grown proteins and neurogastronomy specialists to co-design a “zero-crumb” bread alternative  
- Brings value: can brief attendees on closed-loop life-support economics, and arrange private tour of his Masdar bio-reactor facility

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to:  
  • Chef Heston Blumenthal (sensory engineering)  
  • Dr. Li Wei (Caltech’s Regolith Bioreactor Group)  
  • Chanelle King (Netflix, unscripted space docuseries)  
- Happy to fund seed-stage teams working on lunar waste-to-water tech (< US $2 M tickets)  
- Best engagement tactic: ask about the taste difference he noticed between ISS-grown mizuna vs. ground controls—he lights up

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Surprising fact: was once Egypt’s national kite-surfing champion; credits wind dynamics for his intuition on fluid flow in bioreactors  
- Prefers meetings over tactical walks—even on the Moon he plans to pace the habitat loop while talking numbers  
- Soft spot for under-represented founders; host could explore joint scholarship program under Oasis Frontier  
- Follow-up Q: status of basalt substrate safety data—any toxicity flags before 2027 field trial?
