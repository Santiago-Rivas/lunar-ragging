### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** DR. JANE GOODALL, DB

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Bournemouth, UK; maintains a small retreat near Gombe Stream, Tanzania
- Constant flyer: ~300 days/year pre-pandemic; now opts for clustered “advocacy sprints” (3-week global loops, then 4-week recovery at home) to conserve energy

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder, Jane Goodall Institute (JGI) – 28 country offices, $45 M annual budget
- UN Messenger of Peace; Roots & Shoots youth program active in 70+ nations
- Pioneer of long-term chimpanzee field study; redefined understanding of tool use and social bonds in animals

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling “Trees for Tomorrow” reforestation campaign to 10 M plantings by 2027; exploring blockchain-verified growth tracking
- Partnering with satellite-driven biodiversity platform EarthRanger to monitor chimp habitats in real time
- Piloting VR/AR curricula that place students “inside” Gombe to spark conservation empathy
- Personal: documenting unpublished field journals (1963–1968) into an interactive memoir; intends to finish before her 93rd birthday

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong fascination with sci-fi; credits H.G. Wells for early curiosity about non-human intelligence
- Keeps a pocket-sized carved wooden chimp named “Mr. H” for luck—surprisingly enjoys showing it to break formal tension
- Guiding maxim: “Only when we understand, will we care; only when we care, will we help; and only when we help shall all be saved.”
- Unpublicized hobby: sketching lunar landscapes from telescope observations during COVID lockdown nights

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a symbolic moment to foreground planetary stewardship before humanity becomes a multi-world species
- Seeks dialogue on closed-loop life-support lessons transferable to fragile Earth ecosystems
- Hopes to secure commitments from tech founders to integrate Roots & Shoots chapters into future space-habitat schooling
- Will bring a short blessing quoting both Earth and Moon perspectives—could be a memorable agenda highlight

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: sustainable space-agriculture entrepreneurs, mission psychologists studying isolation social dynamics, and high-net-worth families funding climate literacy
- Attendees can assist by offering pro-bono tech for chimp DNA e-banking and drone corridor mapping in Congo Basin
- Engagement tips: quiet seating area, herbal tea on hand, open-ended questions about youth optimism; ask “What surprised you most on your first night alone in Gombe?” to unlock rich stories

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Schedule around early-evening lunar time; she retires by 22:00 Earth UTC equivalent
- Avoid plastic water bottles in her presence—provide stainless steel or glass
- Follow-up query for future call: interest level in co-authoring an op-ed on ethical frameworks for extraterrestrial biospheres with Planta’s CEO
