### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Peter Attia, MD

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Austin, TX; maintains satellite offices in New York and San Diego for clinical consulting and podcast production
- Regular monthly hop to Miami (longevity clinic pilot) and Montréal (Zero-G physiology project with McGill)
- Comfortable with long-haul travel; uses time aloft for deep-work literature review blocks

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Early Medical—precision longevity practice serving ~250 ultra-high-net-worth patients worldwide
- Host, “The Drive” podcast (>65 M downloads) and NYT-bestselling author of “Outlive”
- Angel investor/advisor to >15 biotech and wearables startups (Levels, Oura, Rejuveron)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Building a cloud-based “AttiaOS” platform that turns individualized biomarker data into actionable protocols; private beta with 40 VIPs
- Raising a $50 M Opportunity Fund focused on senolytics, glymphatic-drainage tech, and lab-grade CGMs
- Personally experimenting with combined zone-2 cycling in hypobaric chambers and high-protein Mediterranean diet to shave 30 sec off 10-mile row erg PR
- Publishing second book in 2026: “Stability”—bridging emotional resilience, neurochemistry, and longevity

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Spearfishing freediver; fascinated by breath-hold physiology and CO₂ tolerance—expects lunar low-gravity could amplify ventilatory insights
- Weekend F1 simulator racer; uses telemetry overlay to teach deliberate practice concepts
- Guiding principle: “Precision plus consistency beats intensity every time”
- Collects vintage mechanical watches to study micro-engineering longevity parallels

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending as keynote “human performance” voice; curious how partial gravity, circadian shifts, and cosmic radiation intersect with lifespan mechanisms
- Seeking collaborators to design a 30-day post-lunar biometric study (continuous glucose, HRV, endothelial function) on future Moon crews
- Brings credibility and an engaged audience—will record a special episode of The Drive on-site if permissible

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intro to ESA’s Space Medicine Office and SpaceX life-support R&D team would fast-track his lunar physiology protocol
- Interested in meeting chefs experimenting with protein structure at sub-1G to discuss nutrient bioavailability
- Easy hook: ask about his 28-mile Catalina Channel swim in shark-repelling wetsuit—launches him into flow, then pivot to event themes
- Suggest private roundtable: “Microgravity & Metabolic Flexibility” with investors, astronauts, and biotech founders

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Values ruthless evidence; disengages when conversation drifts into supplement folklore
- Prefers decaf espresso; abstains from alcohol outside specific glucose tolerance experiments
- Surprising tidbit: once sculpted bronze maquettes under artist Richard MacDonald to hone “hands-on” mindfulness—useful answer for host’s icebreaker
- Follow-up Q: status of his collaboration with Neuralink on closed-loop glycemic regulation—potential lunar application?
