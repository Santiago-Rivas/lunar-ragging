### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Angelique Kerber

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Puszczykowo, Poland (family home & Kerber Tennis Academy HQ)
- Secondary hubs: Munich (sponsors, media) and Dubai (off-season training)
- Travel rhythm: 30+ weeks on tour circuits; added quarterly visits to U.S. for wellness-tech board meetings

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Three-time Grand Slam champion; former WTA world No. 1
- Founder, AK-Performance Group – umbrella for academy, sports-tech angel fund, and branded wellness products
- Olympic Silver Medalist (Rio 2016) & current athlete-representative to German Olympic Committee on athlete motherhood policies

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Targeting final full season on tour (2025) culminating in a farewell run at Wimbledon 2026
- Scaling AK-Performance Fund II (€45 M) to back female-led health, recovery, and neurotech ventures
- Building a mixed-reality “Mind-Court” training platform with Adidas R&D for cognitive-motor conditioning
- Personally exploring post-athlete identity: early morning sketching habit evolving into a children’s picture-book series on resilience

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Certified commercial drone pilot; uses aerial footage to analyze footwork patterns
- Obsessive about circadian-lighting science—travels with portable tunable LED panels
- Favorite mantra: “Quiet legs, loud heart.” Believes performance hinges on controlled stillness amid chaos
- Enjoys improv theatre as off-court mental training; occasional cameo at Munich’s English-language improv nights

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar gravity (1/6 g) excites her curiosity on proprioception and athletic biomechanics; eager to test mini-court prototypes in low-g
- Seeks dialogue on immersive social platforms that can broadcast elite sports narratives in extraterrestrial venues
- Offers expertise on high-performance habit formation, mental toughness, and global brand storytelling to invigorate event discussion panels

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: ESA Human Physiology Lab (for joint low-g motion study), Porsche Sustainability Ventures (possible co-investment), and any XR food-experience designers present
- Can mentor founders on athlete marketing, female-centric product design, and European market entry
- Ideal engagement: invite her to co-host a spontaneous “moon-court movement challenge” or a short guided visualization on pre-performance breathing

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: limits conversation about family life in press settings; comfortable in private, off-record chats
- Ask her “What small creative ritual centers you before walking on court?”—she’ll reveal her lesser-known 60-second sketch habit (ties to host’s conversation goal)
- Follow-up area: gauge interest in serving as ambassador for Planta’s planned Earth-to-Moon holographic wellness series
