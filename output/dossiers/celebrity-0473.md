### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jordan Rancie

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Vancouver, BC, with lab annex in Pasadena, CA (close to JPL).
- Monthly shuttle to ESA’s ESTEC campus in Noordwijk; habitual red-eye traveler who codes on flights.

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Lumenix BioSystems – pioneers of bioluminescent micro-gardens for low-gravity habitats; recent $70 M NASA Translational Research award.
- Former systems engineer, SpaceX Crew & Life-Support Division; credited on Crew Dragon ECLSS patents.
- 2024 MIT Technology Review “35 Innovators Under 35” for closed-loop photobioreactor work.

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Fast-tracking Series B round ($120 M) to scale algae-light tiles for Artemis Base Camp.
- Negotiating joint venture with Panasonic to embed bio-light panels in consumer smart walls.
- Personal quest: qualify Lumenix’s Spirulina strain as a culinary “super-umami”—targets Michelin chefs for co-branding by Q3 2026.
- Preparing white paper on circadian-aligned lighting for Mars transit vehicles; aims to seat on upcoming IAC standards committee.

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend freediver; can hold breath 5 min 42 sec—claims the discipline sharpens decision-making under pressure.
- Keeps a notebook of one-line science fiction plots; sells selected ideas to indie game studios.
- Guiding philosophy: “If biology can do it quietly, engineering shouldn’t do it loudly.”
- Enjoys table-top astrophotography—miniature lunar landscapes photographed under real moonlight.

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Lumenix’s algae-light gardens are ideal mood lighting and CO₂ scrubbers for the Sea of Tranquility base; Planta Network testing integration.
- Seeks candid feedback from taste-makers on algae-infused hors d’oeuvres; open to live sensory demos.
- Can contribute a portable “living chandelier” that glows to guests’ heartbeats—high-impact visual for press images.

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired:  
  • Chef Alain Ducasse (space cuisine line)  
  • Audrey Horne, head of ESA Habitat Design  
  • Leo Zhang, Lightspeed Venture Partners (deep-tech fund)
- Attendees can help by sharing use-cases where ambient bio-light enhances mental health in isolated environments.
- Engagement tip: ask about his breath-hold record or sci-fi notebook—rapidly shifts him into storytelling mode.

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers walking meetings over seated chats; zero-gravity drift sessions even better.
- Sensitive point: resists discussion of a 2023 algae contamination incident at JAXA; reframe as lessons-learned.
- Follow-up after event: invite him to co-author Planta white paper on “Multisensory Biophilia in Off-World Dining.”
