### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Warren Edward Buffett

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Omaha, Nebraska (still keeps modest routine at Kiewit Plaza headquarters)
- Rarely travels except for Berkshire AGM & select board meetings; this lunar excursion signals extraordinary interest

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chairman & CEO, Berkshire Hathaway (market cap ≈ $905 B)
- Steward of $130 B+ cash war chest; globally watched for “elephant-sized” acquisitions
- Co-founder, The Giving Pledge; lifetime philanthropic commitments now exceed $130 B

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing succession blueprint: empowering Greg Abel & Ajit Jain while retaining decisive capital-allocation voice through 2027
- Evaluating long-duration infrastructure bets (clean-power grids, global data centers, off-planet logistics) that deliver multi-decade compounding
- Scaling philanthropic disbursements: advancing maternal health, pandemic readiness, and low-cost nuclear energy via newly seeded “Midlands Catalyst Fund”
- Personal ambition: compile and release “Investor’s Almanac for the 22nd Century,” distilling lessons for post-Buffett Berkshire

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Keeps nightly bridge sessions with Bill Gates on an experimental mixed-reality platform; enjoys testing human–AI partnership at the game table
- Reads at least five hours daily; fascinated by behavioral economics research on scarcity mentality in space colonization
- Favorite aphorism for 2025: “Price is what you pay—escape velocity is what you get.”
- Unusual fact most don’t know: practices Cajun jazz ukulele—learned during Katrina relief visits, uses it to relax before major capital calls

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attendance underscores Berkshire’s quiet study of lunar insurance, habitat re-supply, and space-rated utilities; seeks firsthand operational risk insights
- Curious about Planta Network’s human-connection analytics—potential application for Berkshire portfolio companies (retail, travel, energy)
- Wants candid dialogue on safeguarding “compounding cultures” in extreme environments; open to sharing wisdom on trust & decentralized decision-making
- Could headline a micro-panel on “Perennial Investing Beyond Earth,” lending gravitas and media lift to the event

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • SpaceX Starshield insurance team  
  • Hitachi Energy lunar micro-grid leads  
  • The Rockefeller Foundation’s “Space for Humanity” philanthropy arm
- Ask attendees for on-the-ground (or on-the-moon) data about maintenance cycles, mental-health costs, and logistics premiums—inputs for Berkshire actuarial models
- Engage him with concise, numbers-anchored briefs; offer a moon-surface mini-tour focused on utilities and supply chain—he values operational details over spectacle

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: prefers succession questions stay off-record; defer to post-2027 announcements
- Avoid lengthier VR demos—motion sensitivity
- Follow-up Qs: appetite for co-investing in modular nuclear reactors for lunar bases; interest in funding a student-led “Moonshot Accounting Fellowship” to groom future Berkshire analysts in situ
