### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong space enthusiast—keeps an Apollo-11 patch framed in office; childhood dream was NASA test pilot  
- Amateur astrophotographer; travels with a compact RedCat 71 telescope and shares shots only with close circle  
- Guiding maxim: “Innovate from a place of optimism—audiences feel the intent.”  
- Enjoys surprise tasting menus; obsessed with how chefs “storyboard” a meal—great hook for Planta’s culinary angle

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • Gwynne Shotwell (SpaceX) for launch manifest synergies  
  • Chef Virgilio Martínez for cross-cultural menu collab in cosmic environments  
  • Global sovereign wealth funds eyeing “space tourism REITs”  
- Ask attendees to brief him on sustainable power, waste-to-resource tech, and low-g entertainment ergonomics

- Prefers disciplined time management; 10-minute conversations are ideal—schedule follow-ups through his COS, Christine McCarthy  
- Follow-up probe: status of patented “Storyliving in Orbit” framework filed by Disney R&D in March 2025—licensing openness?
