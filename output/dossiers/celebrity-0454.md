### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Hla Hla Win

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Yangon, Myanmar  
- Secondary work hubs: Singapore (fund-raising & prototyping), Boston/Cambridge (research partnerships with MIT Media Lab)  
- Travel rhythm: 2-3 weeks each quarter in Silicon Valley; quarterly meditation retreats in Northern Thailand for digital detox

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & CEO, 360ed – AR/VR-powered learning company servicing 3.2 M students across Southeast Asia  
- Former high-school teacher turned MIT Global Founder; only Myanmar-born entrepreneur to win a WISE Award for Innovation in Education  
- Recognized in Forbes Asia “100 to Watch” and TED Fellow; routinely briefs UNESCO and World Bank on immersive learning for low-connectivity regions

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a $28 M Series B to localize AI-adaptive STEM curricula in eight new languages by Q4 2025  
- Negotiating a joint venture with a Shenzhen headset OEM to produce a $79 stand-alone AR visor designed for unreliable power grids  
- Pilot program integrating Starlink-class satellite bandwidth to reach conflict-affected rural schools  
- Personal stretch goal: earn her instrument-rated pilot license before 2026 to “see clouds the way students see atoms—up close”

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong collector of meteorite fragments; sees them as “portable time machines for classroom awe”  
- Deeply influenced by Thích Nhất Hạnh—keeps a handwritten quote in her wallet: “The next Buddha will be a collective”  
- Enjoys composing hip-hop lyrics in Burmese; has a private SoundCloud channel shared only with mentees  
- Nutrition hacker: experiments with spirulina-based Burmese mohinga as climate-resilient comfort food

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence underscores the link between frontier environments (lunar base) and frontier classrooms on Earth  
- Seeks dialogue on designing zero-gravity learning modules—wants to co-create a “Lunar Lab Kit” for STEM inspiration back home  
- Curious how Planta’s social-connectivity APIs can be repurposed for peer-to-peer learning in bandwidth-scarce regions  
- Brings storytelling chops: can capture the dinner’s narrative for UNESCO’s 2027 “Future of Learning Beyond Earth” report

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • SpaceX Starlink education liaison  
  • Autodesk Foundation (grant support for XR content)  
  • Patagonia’s climate-education funders exploring Southeast Asia  
- Offer to host moon-themed AR pop-up classes at attendees’ alma maters  
- Best engagement: ask about the meteorite piece she keeps in her pocket—she loves handing it over for tactile connection

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Politically sensitive home market; prefers discussions framed around “access” rather than “regime change”  
- Responds warmly to direct asks for student stories; less interest in generic VR boosterism  
- Follow-up curiosity: which lunar gravity variables most affect adolescent spatial reasoning? She’s collecting data points for a 2026 white paper
