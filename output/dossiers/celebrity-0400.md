### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Adele Goldberg

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Berkeley, California
- Splits time with a quieter retreat in Santa Fe; monthly hops to Zürich and Tokyo for research consortium meetings
- Predictable travel rhythm: two international trips per quarter, always back in Berkeley for weekend mentoring sessions at UC Berkeley’s Sky Computing Lab

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-creator of the Smalltalk programming language; former President, ACM
- Chair, Ideation Group at PARC Alumni Ventures—funds HCI startups pushing “computing beyond screens”
- Lead advisor, NSF’s Cognitive Interfaces Initiative; has shepherded >$300 M in grants toward embodied computing and educational tech

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Drafting “Designing for Curiosity,” a hybrid memoir/handbook on exploratory interfaces (target publication Q4 2026)
- Incubating a lunar-optimized micro-kernel “Pebble” for constrained, radiation-resilient computing environments
- Personal mission: double the number of women principal investigators in NSF HCI awards within five years
- Exploring cross-disciplinary art residencies to merge choreography with live-coded visuals—first showcase planned at Ars Electronica 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend passion: 19th-century mechanical toys; maintains a private collection of 70 wind-up automatons
- Completed a silent-retreat glass-blowing residency in Murano—finds parallels between molten glass flow and object-oriented message passing
- Guiding maxim: “Interfaces should reveal possibilities, not paths.” Believes every new medium must start with playful exploration before structured use emerges

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a living lab for social computation in extreme environments—keen to observe how latency, confinement, and novelty alter group dynamics
- Actively seeking partners for Pebble pilot deployments inside lunar habitats and orbiter labs
- Brings four decades of systems-thinking; can articulate historical lessons from Alto/Smalltalk to current XR and space habitation tools
- Wants candid conversation on: “How will we teach the first generation of children born off-planet?”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX Starlink Edge Compute team, ESA’s Moon Village Education Unit, MIT Media Lab’s SpaceAugmented group
- Potential contributions: workshops on rapid prototyping of lunar-ready interfaces; mentorship circles for young technologists on the mission
- Engagement tips: Offer a puzzle or historical artifact to spark dialogue—she loves intellectual Easter eggs and hands-on demos

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Surprising tidbit worth asking (aligns with host’s goal): she once co-piloted a solar-powered glider across the Sierra Nevada—rarely publicized but reveals her risk-embracing side
- Sensitive point: politely avoid comparing Smalltalk solely to modern app frameworks; she prefers discussions on conceptual lineage, not nostalgia
- Follow-up: gauge interest in recording a short “lunar fireside chat” for Planta’s archival series—she values well-curated oral histories
