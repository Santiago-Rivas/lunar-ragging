- Routinely hops between LA–NY–London on a 6-week loop; adds Tokyo every Q4 for Yitty supply-chain checks
- Recently negotiated a three-year “artist-in-orbit” partnership with SpaceX—expects quarterly suborbital training trips at Starbase, TX

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Grammy-winning singer-songwriter, rapper, classically trained flutist
- Founder & Chief Visionary, Yitty by Lizzo—size-inclusive activewear now valued at $750 M
- Exec-producer of “Big Grrrl Got Game,” an interactive music-fitness platform that hit 12 M paid users in 18 months

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Composing a concept album “Low-G” engineered for reduced-gravity acoustics; aims to record portions inside an orbital studio module in 2026
- Scaling Yitty’s new biodegradable fabric line (algae-based fibers); seeking aerospace-grade material testing
- Personal passion project: a nationwide initiative placing concert-grade flutes in under-funded public schools—pilot launches fall 2025
- Quietly preparing for a 2027 Senate hearing on mental-health equity in entertainment

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects vintage sci-fi pulp magazines; swears Ray Bradbury shaped her stage storytelling
- Lives by the mantra “Radical self-love is a renewable resource”
- Obsessed with synesthesia; works with MIT Media Lab to visualize sound as color gradients for VR concerts
- Low-key gamer—top 1% “Apex Legends” support-class leaderboard under pseudonym “FlûtForceOne”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- First mainstream artist cleared for micro-gravity performance—keen to demo a flute riff during the lunar dinner
- Hunting for collaborators who blend culinary science with sound design to match courses to live music frequencies
- Wants candid dialogue on building inclusive social spaces in off-world habitats—leveraging her fan community research

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: NASA Acoustic Physics team (lunar sound propagation), Stella McCartney’s sustainable materials R&D head, and venture arm of Patagonia for algae-fiber co-funding
- Offers: headline a holographic after-party, lend mass-appeal marketing heft, mentor emerging artist-entrepreneurs attending
- Engage by asking about her childhood flute teacher Ms. Garvin—rarely discussed but formative; perfect segue into education equity talk

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers authenticity over formality—ditch suits for jumpsuits, share playlists not pitch decks
- Surprising fact prompt: She once earned a competitive gaming scholarship offer before choosing music—great hook for the host
- Potential follow-up: explore featuring Yitty’s lunar-suitable garments in the event’s VR fashion showcase
- Sensitive: avoids on-the-record Q&A about 2023 harassment lawsuit; steer conversation toward forward-looking projects instead
