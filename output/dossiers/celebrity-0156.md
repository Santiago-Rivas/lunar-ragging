### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Saoirse Ronan

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Splits time between Greystones, County Wicklow (family home on Irish coast) and a discreet townhouse in North London
- Regular three-week “creative sabbaticals” in New York and Reykjavik; favors remote Atlantic settings for script work

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Four-time Oscar-nominated actor; Co-founder & Principal, Ard Eala Productions (launched 2024 to champion female-led Irish features)
- Recent highlights: executive-produced & starred in “Wild Atlantic,” Sundance 2025 Audience Award; lead in Chris Nolan’s “Möbius,” premiering December 2025
- Reputation for seamless crossover between prestige cinema, theatre (West End’s “Macbeth” 2024), and narrative XR installations

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Packaging her directorial debut, a near-future eco-thriller set on an autonomous ocean platform; target shoot Q2 2026
- Negotiating a multiyear partnership with Apple Vision Pro Studios for immersive adaptations of Irish folklore
- Personal mission: elevate sustainability standards in film production; building a Green Set Protocol toolkit with BFI grant support
- Intensifying physical conditioning for parabolic-flight training (research for both upcoming space-themed role and lunar dinner commitment)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur astrophotographer; owns a 12-inch Dobsonian telescope and routinely tracks lunar libration from Wicklow cliffs
- Gaelic poetry enthusiast—carries a dog-eared Seamus Heaney collection; believes “language is the portal to belonging”
- Loves experimental cuisine; currently fascinated by umami profiles in kelp-based fermentation
- Keeps a low digital footprint; values intimate, ideas-driven dialogue over publicity

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Moon Dinner as a live laboratory for storytelling beyond Earth’s gravity—a setting she is considering for a VR short
- Seeks collaborators versed in closed-loop agri-tech to inform sustainable food narratives in her eco-thriller
- Brings global media magnetism and an ability to translate technical breakthroughs into emotionally resonant narratives

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: SpaceX Inspiration Labs (life-support R&D), Studio Gilhooly (avant-garde culinary design), and LVMH’s experiential marketing team
- Could mentor technologists on narrative framing; in exchange, needs rapid-cycle prototyping access for immersive content
- Best engagement: invite her to sample experimental lunar-grown herbs while discussing how sensory constraints shape character arcs

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers phonetic cue “SEER-sha” at first greeting; appreciates hosts who try an Irish phrase (“Cén chaoi a bhfuil tú?”)
- Avoid long discussions of celebrity culture; pivot to craft or sustainability
- Follow-up curiosity: which lunar vista would most inspire her Heaney recitation?-------------</
