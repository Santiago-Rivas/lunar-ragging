### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Mark Russinovich

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Redmond, WA (Microsoft HQ)  
- Secondary footholds: Austin (family ties, annual SXSW keynote), Washington D.C. (federal cloud & cybersecurity briefings)  
- Travel rhythm: 2-week global loop—Silicon Valley → Tel Aviv → Berlin—aligning Azure confidential-computing roadshows; sched­uled zero-g flight training at NASTAR every six months “for fun and future off-planet audits”

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chief Technology Officer, Microsoft Azure (>$125 B run-rate)  
- Co-founder, Sysinternals; author, seminal Windows Internals series  
- Architect behind Azure OpenAI SuperCluster & confidential VMs adopted by 40+ nations’ defense agencies  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Standing up next-gen AI supercompute region powered by fusion-pilot micro-reactor (slated 2026)  
- Hardening global supply chain via “silicon attestation” push—chip-to-cloud root-of-trust baked into every new Azure rack  
- Personal project: finishing fourth cyber-thriller novel “LOW-EARTH THREAT” (delivery to Macmillan Q4 2025)  
- Eyeing lunar-edge compute pods for scientific workloads—internal white paper due July 2025; wants real user stories

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Marathoner (Boston sub-3:10); swears by negative-split pacing for code reviews—“Start cautious, finish ruthless”  
- Weekend tinkerer: reverse-engineers vintage spacecraft guidance software, posts annotated disassemblies under alias “Apogee”  
- Favorite guiding quote: “The system always tells the truth—you just need the right tool to listen.”  
- Enjoys pairing obscure wines with Tex-Mex; curious how terroir translates in low gravity

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: evaluating how Planta’s social-tech stack could inform Azure’s mixed-reality collaboration suite for orbital crews  
- Actively seeking: collaborators on lunar networking latency mitigation (<350 ms RTT goal); chefs exploring AI-generated menus for constrained habitats  
- Value offered: deep expertise in resilient, air-gapped computing; can preview Azure’s edge-AI toolchain for remote life-support diagnostics

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX Starlink LEO-to-Luna team; ESA radiation-hard electronics group; architect of JAXA’s mini-reactor project  
- Ways attendees can help: share datasets from extreme-environment sensors; offer feedback on UX of holographic incident-response cockpit  
- Engagement tips: open with a clever debugging anecdote; segue to his secret passion for vintage NASA assembly code—he’ll light up

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Time-boxed conversationalist—prefers structured 10-min slices; schedule micro-meetings, not sprawling chats  
- Dislikes empty futurism—back every moonshot with numbers  
- Follow-up questions: 1) progress on silicon attestation consortium; 2) release window for “LOW-EARTH THREAT” audiobook narrated by him
