### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Werner Vogels

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Seattle, WA (Amazon HQ)
- Maintains apartment in Amsterdam; splits summer months there
- Regular travel corridor: Washington DC → Cape Canaveral (Project Kuiper launches) → global AWS regions (São Paulo, Frankfurt, Mumbai)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chief Technology Officer & VP, Amazon.com; steward of the company’s long-term tech vision since 2005
- Architected the principles behind AWS (micro-services, “you build it, you run it” culture)
- Key influence: Global adoption of cloud resilience practices—quoted in ISO/IEC guidance on distributed systems

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling Amazon Bedrock & Titan models to compete with OpenAI-Microsoft stack
- Orchestrating Project Kuiper’s 3,200-satellite deployment and edge-compute payloads
- Prototyping lunar-surface data nodes with Blue Origin engineers; goal: sub-150 ms Earth-Moon round-trip latency by 2028
- Personal 2025–26 agenda: completing a book on “Planet-Scale Fault Tolerance” (contract signed with O’Reilly)
- Quietly investing in European deep-tech startups focused on sustainable cooling (e.g., submerged cryofluids)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Plays drums in a heavy-metal trio—keeps an electronic kit in his Seattle office for de-stress jams
- Amateur street photographer; has a Leica Q3 dedicated to night shots of industrial sites
- Guiding maxim: “Everything fails, all the time—design for it.”
- Surprising fact: Began college in medical school before pivoting to computer science after dissecting a heart

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Designing compute and connectivity layers that make off-world social experiences seamless—Planta’s lunar dinner is a real-world stress test
- Seeking candid feedback on human perception of latency and immersion when literally “off Earth”
- Wants to swap notes on closed-loop food production tech for future orbital data centers’ cafeterias
- Can contribute: decade of lessons on scaling digital platforms + resources of AWS/Kuiper for lunar comms backbone

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Chief chef behind the event (interested in sensor-rich kitchens)  
  • Venture partners funding off-world habitation (e.g., Space Capital, Lux)  
  • Cognitive scientists studying time-dilation perception in VR
- How attendees can help: Share empirical UX data from zero-G prototypes; co-design “failure injection” drills for lunar infrastructure
- Best engagement tactic: Open with a failure story—ask “What broke during your first Moon rehearsal?” He’ll dive in enthusiastically.

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid labor-relation or antitrust probes during casual talk—he tires of the topic
- Prefers practical demos over slide decks; bring a gadget or proof-of-concept if pitching
- Follow-up questions for deeper rapport:  
  • Status of his submerged-cooling pilot in the Netherlands  
  • Would he host a remote metal jam session from Moon to Earth during re:Invent 2027?
