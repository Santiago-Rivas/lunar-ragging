### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio (Bad Bunny)

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: Vega Baja, PR & Los Angeles, CA  
- Keeps a private writing cabin near Rincón for surf breaks and uninterrupted studio time  
- Regular 3-week “immersion hops” to Tokyo and Barcelona for fashion and visual-art collaborations  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Latin trap & reggaetón global icon; first Spanish-language artist to top Billboard’s year-end Top Artist list  
- Founder, Rimas Labs: multimedia incubator blending music, AR/VR, and streetwear drops  
- Executive producer & lead actor, forthcoming Amazon Prime neo-noir series set in post-hurricane Puerto Rico  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Recording sixth studio album “Satélite” using AI-generated lunar resonance samples licensed from NASA’s Artemis program  
- Building a carbon-negative performance venue in San Juan powered by ocean-thermal energy  
- Expanding “El Apoyo” scholarship fund—goal: 1,000 Latino aerospace and creative-tech fellows by 2028  
- Personal ambition: earn a zero-gravity pilot certification before his 33rd birthday  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects vintage Lucha Libre masks; designs a new one pre-tour as “creative armor”  
- Meditation routine built around Afro-Taino drumming; credits it for lyrical spontaneity  
- Guiding maxim: “La música rompe la gravedad cuando la comunidad la sostiene” (“Music beats gravity when community lifts it”)  
- Low-key manga nerd—keeps first-edition “Akira” in a climate-controlled flight case  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as test-bed for immersive fan rituals he wants to stage on Earth and, eventually, orbiting venues  
- Looking to swap ideas on how micro-gravity alters flavor perception and live-performance acoustics  
- Hopes to meet hardware partners for a 2027 VR “moon encore” streamed from the Sea of Tranquility site  
- Will contribute cultural cachet, social amplification (120 M+ socials), and willingness to perform an unreleased track if latency issues solved  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: SpaceX “Starship Art & Culture” team, MIT Media Lab’s Opera of the Future group, Patagonia leadership on regenerative supply chain  
- Attendees can assist by sharing rapid-deployment modular stage tech or lunar-sourced basalt acoustic panel research  
- Engage him with questions about sensory shifts in space and how Latin percussion might “float”—avoid small talk about chart statistics  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers conversational Spanish but appreciates bilingual code-switching; keep slang authentic  
- Usually travels with two close creative aides—limit secondary invitees in side meetings  
- Off-record curiosity: has he secured song rights for planned holographic duet with Héctor Lavoe archives?  
- Potential follow-up: gauge interest in curating a post-event charity NFT drop benefiting lunar science education in Caribbean schools
