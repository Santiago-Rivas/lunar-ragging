### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Vinod Khosla

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Woodside, CA  
- Regular shuttle between San Francisco ↔ New York (fund LPs) and Bengaluru (family & India climate initiatives)  
- Quarterly “deep-dive” retreats in Jackson Hole and occasional parabolic-flight training sessions at Ellington Field, Houston  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Partner, Khosla Ventures (>$16 B AUM across climate, deep-tech, AI)  
- Co-founder, Sun Microsystems; board/advisory roles at Impossible Foods, QuantumScape, OpenAI (early backer)  
- Key influence: outspoken advocate for moon-shot R&D unencumbered by legacy regulation—frequently briefs U.S. Senate and EU Commission on tech policy  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing KV Fund VII ($4 B) with a carve-out for “Off-World Infrastructure & Bio-Sustenance”  
- Steering portfolio companies on generative-AI-fueled drug discovery and zero-carbon cement scale-up  
- Personal quest: proving that moon-based biomanufacturing can out-compete terrestrial supply chains by 2032  
- Mentoring his daughter’s new climate-fintech start-up; aligning family office philanthropy with Global South adaptation projects  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend glider pilot—earned rare “Diamond C” badge; says silent flight sharpens his risk intuition  
- Collects first-edition Urdu poetry; enjoys quoting Ghalib to illustrate venture lessons (“The sky’s the limit, but desire still reaches further”)  
- Core philosophy: “Failure is the tuition for audacious success—pay it quickly and move on.”  
- Unusual fact most overlook: once spent a summer apprenticing in an ashram kitchen—still experiments with plant-protein fermentation at home  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a live sandbox for testing low-gravity food systems and social UX—directly aligns with his off-world biomanufacturing thesis  
- Wants candid chats with engineers on closed-loop agriculture and waste-to-protein conversion  
- Brings value: capital, policy access, and a 40-year playbook for scaling nascent technical platforms  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload lead; JAXA’s life-support R&D head; sovereign wealth funds pursuing space equities  
- Attendees can help by sharing proprietary data on lunar radiation’s effect on microbes—he’s funding a study and needs collaborators  
- Best engagement: present contrarian viewpoints; propose “impossible” timelines—he responds well to boldness and first-principle math  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers brisk, idea-dense dialogue; small talk drains quickly—open with a provocative question (“Would you fund a lunar IPO in 2029?”)  
- Sensitive area: skeptical of incremental ESG narratives—frame impact in terms of scale and unit economics, not virtue  
- Follow-up questions to explore: status of his rumored SPAC targeting space-based power; interest level in Planta’s upcoming Series A for orbital hospitality.
