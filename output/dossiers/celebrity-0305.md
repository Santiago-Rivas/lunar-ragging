### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Zhang Yiming

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Singapore (family residence) & Beijing (ByteDance strategic HQ)
- Regular circuits: San Francisco (product/AI scouting), Dubai (family office), Reykjavík (data-center & green-energy visits)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & former CEO, ByteDance; architect of TikTok’s global algorithmic engine
- Oversees Oceanic Capital, a $6 B personal fund backing frontier consumer tech, spatial computing, and biotech
- Credited with mainstreaming short-form video culture; net worth ≈ $40 B

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Building a stealth social OS that merges generative AI, AR glasses, and real-time mood sensing—internal codename “Nebula”
- Negotiating a minority stake in an ispace-Japan lunar data relay venture; sees cislunar internet as the next “mobile moment”
- Personally upskilling in neuromorphic hardware; weekly remote sessions with Prof. Kwabena Boahen’s Stanford lab
- Health & longevity: regimented intermittent fasting, VO₂-max training, investing in epigenetic reprogramming start-ups

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong sci-fi reader (favorites: Liu Cixin’s “Ball Lightning,” Ted Chiang’s short stories); enjoys deconstructing narrative arcs with product analogies
- Practices Zen-inspired minimalism—travels with a single 20-L backpack
- Operates by the credo “Let the data whisper, not shout”—eschews vanity metrics
- Collects vintage slide rules; fascinated by pre-digital computation as design inspiration

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a live sandbox to test social bonding without terrestrial bias; intrigued by how microgravity alters attention spans and content creation patterns
- Aims to meet edge-case thinkers in human-computer interaction, synthetic gastronomy, and space psychology for Nebula advisory roles
- Offers insight into large-scale content moderation, algorithmic personalization, and cross-culture virality for an off-world audience

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to: 
  • Dr. Alice Carter (NASA Habitability), 
  • Chef Andoni Luis Aduriz (molecular cuisine), 
  • Helios Labs (regolith-to-metal refining)
- Could gift fellow guests early-access Nebula AR lenses for an on-site demo, capturing mixed-reality memories of the dinner
- Engages best through small, curiosity-driven problem-solving sessions—suggest a moon-surface walk to brainstorm “lunar latency” UX challenges

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Media-averse; prefers conversations away from cameras—confirm privacy protocols on the base
- Avoid prolonged discussion of U.S.–China data politics; steers toward forward-looking, apolitical tech themes
- Follow-up inquiry: gauge interest in co-funding a lunar social-analytics observatory to study interaction patterns over multi-day stays
