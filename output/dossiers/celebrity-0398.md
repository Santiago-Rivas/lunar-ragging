### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Ken Thompson

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Mountain View, California  
- Secondary retreat: remote lakeside cabin near Lake Tahoe; spends several weeks each quarter off-grid for “deep work”  
- Travel rhythm: selective; limits appearances to 2–3 high-impact events per year (prefers intimate, ideas-driven gatherings over large conferences)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Distinguished Engineer Emeritus, Google Systems Infrastructure Group  
- Co-creator of UNIX, Plan 9, B language, and early contributor to Go; Turing Award (1983) & National Medal of Technology (1998)  
- Current advisory roles with Open Source Security Foundation and NASA JPL’s Onboard Autonomy Task Force

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Drafting a pragmatic “Operating Systems for Off-World Habitats” whitepaper—targets publication Q4 2025  
- Mentoring a small stealth team at Google X exploring post-POSIX microkernels optimized for radiation-hardened RISC-V chips  
- Personal goal: finalize a digital archive of his original Bell Labs notebooks before his 85th birthday (Feb 2028)  
- Quietly funding scholarships for first-generation CS students through the Ken & Bonnie Thompson Fund

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong sailor; currently designing autonomous sail drones for Pacific data collection  
- Enjoys constructing mechanical puzzles—built a fully operational binary adder out of LEGO Technic during COVID lockdown  
- Guiding maxim: “Elegance is not aesthetic; it’s the absence of unnecessary decisions.”  
- Maintains a vintage ham-radio station (call sign: KT7) to experiment with low-latency moon-bounce communication

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar dinner aligns with his focus on resilient off-world computing; eager to see how Planta’s social tech performs under lunar latency  
- Wants candid conversations on:  
  • Radiation-induced bit flips and fault-tolerant OS design  
  • Novel human–computer interaction paradigms in partial-gravity environments  
- Brings 50+ years of systems wisdom; likely to offer historical perspective that reframes modern design challenges

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX Starshield avionics team, ESA’s Lunar Gateway comms lead, venture funds backing open hardware (e.g., Eclipse Ventures)  
- Attendees can help by sharing real-world telemetry from space-grade processors or pilot data on human UX in low-g social settings  
- Engaging tactics: skip pleasantries; pose a precise technical question or share an elegant code snippet—he’ll light up instantly

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Hearing in crowded rooms is limited—seek a quieter corner or provide live transcript overlay  
- Unusual fact ready for the host’s prompt: he once embedded a hidden chess endgame database inside a Bell Labs switchboard for late-night practice; discovery took colleagues three years  
- Potential follow-up: explore co-authoring a short piece on “The Next 50 Years of Interplanetary OS Design” for IEEE Spectrum
