### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jimmy Wales

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: London, with a pied-à-terre in Miami for U.S. board meetings  
- Regular circuits: Berlin (policy roundtables), Singapore (APAC philanthropy), and occasional retreats in rural Wales—enjoys the serendipity of sharing a surname with the region

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder, Wikipedia & Wikimedia Foundation; steward of the world’s largest open-knowledge ecosystem  
- Executive Chairman, WT.Social—ad-free social platform focused on verifiable information  
- Board advisor to multiple digital-rights NGOs; UNESCO “Champion of the Internet” laureate  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Building a decentralized “Trust Layer” that crowdsources fact-checking via on-chain attestations; pilot launch Q4 2025  
- Negotiating a strategic alliance with satellite-internet providers to guarantee zero-cost Wikipedia access for remote regions—including future off-planet habitats  
- Personal aim: complete his first transatlantic solo sail in 2026; sees it as a metaphor for knowledge navigation in uncharted waters  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong kite-surfer; claims the sport trained his reflex for spotting informational cross-winds (unexpected bias)  
- Collects first-edition sci-fi novels—especially titles imagining lunar societies (Heinlein, Clarke)  
- Guiding belief: “Information wants to be trusted, not just free.”  
- Unusual fact he enjoys dropping at dinners: once coded a full-text search engine in BASIC on a Commodore 64—still has the floppy  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a living thought experiment: how do we curate a shared knowledge base when a 2.6-second light-lag limits real-time edits?  
- Seeking collaborators to test a low-latency, locally cached “Moon-pedia” node synced with Earth’s databases  
- Offers historical perspective on building volunteer governance models that scale across cultures—vital for extra-terrestrial communities  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros valued to: Starlink’s orbital networking R&D team; ESA’s Lunar Communications Initiative; venture funds backing civic-tech protocols  
- Could mentor early-stage founders crafting transparent AI summarization tools—critical for space crews with limited bandwidth  
- Engage him with questions about knowledge autonomy in closed environments; invite him to sketch governance frameworks on a napkin—he loves impromptu whiteboarding  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Strong aversion to paywalled research; tread carefully when discussing proprietary data silos  
- Prefers informal, curiosity-driven dialogue over prepared pitches—start with a quirky lunar trivia to break the ice  
- Follow-up probe: gauge his appetite for co-authoring a “Declaration of Lunar Knowledge Commons” post-event
