### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jamie Dimon

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Manhattan, NYC (JPMorgan HQ at 383 Madison)
- Secondary touchpoints: Washington, D.C. (policy rounds); London & Singapore (regional operating centers)
- Travel pattern: 200+ flight days/year on the Gulfstream G650—tri-monthly circuits through Silicon Valley, Davos, and major emerging-market capitals

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chairman & CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (market cap ≈ $630 B)
- Architect of Onyx by J.P. Morgan (wholesale blockchain platform) and JPM Coin
- Only large-bank CEO to navigate both the 2008 crisis and the 2023 regional-bank turmoil without federal bailout assistance

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Standing up a dedicated “Space & Off-World Finance” task force—mandate: clearing & settlement protocols for cislunar commerce by 2028
- Generative-AI deployment: 2,000-engineer build-out integrating LLM copilots across Treasury Services
- Succession playbook—three internal contenders being rotated through Consumer, IB, and International divisions; announcement targeted mid-2026
- Personal horizon: post-CEO philanthropic pivot focused on workforce reskilling and veterans’ mental health
- Quiet passion project: funding a scholarship program at Johns Hopkins fostering MD/MBA hybrids to modernize U.S. public-health systems

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Marathon-level runner (completed NYC Marathon sub-4 in 2024) and avid alpine hiker
- Keeps a vintage Leica array and remote New Mexico telescope slot—lunar & deep-sky astrophotography relaxes him after earnings calls
- Favorite leadership maxim: “Fortune favors the prepared mind” (Pasteur, but he attributes it to his father)
- What most people don’t know: once a high-school jazz drummer; still sits in with JPMorgan’s employee band—will happily debate Buddy Rich vs. Tony Williams over cocktails

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: evaluating financial infrastructure needs for lunar tourism, habitat leasing, and resource-extraction ventures
- Seeking candid dialogue on regulatory frameworks for off-Earth commerce (property rights, KYC in micro-gravity, instant payments latency)
- Brings: rollout blueprint for a multi-currency stablecoin basket calibrated for Earth-Moon latency (2.6-second round-trip), plus access to JPM’s capital-markets machine

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:   • SpaceX Starshield treasury team (to pilot settlement node)   • ESA & JAXA policy liaisons   • Sovereign wealth funds eyeing “NewSpace” credit facilities
- Ways attendees can help: ground-truth technical bottlenecks (lunar comms, life-support supply chains) so JPM’s risk models mature quickly
- Engagement tips: lead with data, not hype; he enjoys contrarian takes—challenge him on decentralized finance vs. bank-led rails

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers direct questions; loathes over-scripted pitches
- Jet-lag management: will turn in early—secure your conversation during aperitifs, not nightcap
- Follow-up probes: ask for his view on SEC pace toward a U.S. digital dollar pilot; gauge openness to co-funding a “Lunar Habitat Insurance Facility” with sector peers
