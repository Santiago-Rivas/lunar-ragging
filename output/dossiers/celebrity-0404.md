### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Ai Tong

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: Shanghai & Singapore; maintains micro-studio in San Francisco for West-coast investor meetings  
- Predictable travel loop every six weeks: Shanghai → Houston (NASA/JSC) → San Francisco → Singapore; annual month-long retreat in Hokkaido for deep work  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, LunarLeaf Biotech – world leader in closed-loop, low-gravity horticulture; 72 patents across photobiology, regolith substrates, and autonomous pollination  
- Board director, Asia Pacific Space Association; former Head of Bio-Sustainability at Blue Origin China Program  
- Drove the first fully edible plant cycle aboard Tiangong-2 (2019) and the ISS-XL greenhouse demo (2024)  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing $140 M Series B with Temasek, Breakthrough Energy, and HorizonX to scale modular “Leaf-Pod” farms for Artemis Base Camp  
- Fast-tracking CRISPR-tweaked quinoa species to meet NASA protein targets by 2026  
- Personally authoring a white paper on “Emotional Well-being via Plant-Human Interaction in Micro-gravity”—aims for publication in Nature SpaceLife Q1 2026  
- Non-work ambition: qualifies for the 2028 freedive world championship; uses breath-control practice as stress management  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Plays classical guzheng; travels with a carbon-fiber foldable version designed for orbit  
- Collects heirloom seed vault memorabilia; owns an original 1901 Svalbard vault ledger page  
- Guiding belief: “Life adapts; engineering should follow biology’s rhythm, not force it.”  
- Unusual fact for ice-breaker: secretly writes award-winning speculative fiction under the pen name “Orchid Kōan”; only her agent knows  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Supplying micro-greens and flowering herbs grown in simulated lunar regolith for the dinner menu; eager to observe guests’ sensory reactions  
- Seeking dialogue on integrating social-emotional data from plant-interaction sensors into Planta’s XR layer—wants pilot partners  
- Value offered: Can furnish live Leaf-Pod for the event, provide real-time oxygen & aroma modulation demos, and share growth analytics as open data  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to:  
  • Michelin-star chefs experimenting with zero-waste menus  
  • ESA’s Life Support R&D head Dr. Eveline Gruber (for joint habitat trials)  
  • Documentary teams filming long-duration lunar missions  
- Ways to help: match with materials scientists tackling lightweight radiation-shielded planters; sponsorship of her quinoa trials gains early licensing rights  
- Engagement tips: she responds best to data-rich visuals; mention any unusual plant-human rituals or music fusion concepts to spark instant enthusiasm  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Media-shy after 2023 viral misquote; prefers off-record chats until trust is built  
- Mild motion-induced vertigo in fractional-g settings—carries custom VR stabilization goggles; considerate seating appreciated  
- Follow-up Q: status of cross-licensing talks with JAXA on hybrid algae-plant bioreactors and whether co-branding with Planta is on the table
