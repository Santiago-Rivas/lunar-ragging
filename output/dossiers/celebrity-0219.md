### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Head Coach, FC Barcelona (appointed 2021; contract through 2027)  
- Co-founder, Q37 Analytics – a start-up applying real-time spatial-data modeling to elite team sports  
- FIFA World Cup 2010 champion; four-time UEFA Champions League winner as player

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Delivering a 2025–26 “double” (La Liga & Champions League) with a squad built from ≥60 % academy graduates  
- Closing Series A for Q37 to integrate XR decision-making simulators into youth academies on five continents  
- Personal project: authoring “Geometries of Flow,” a book linking tiki-taka principles with swarm robotics and urban design  
- Exploring regenerative agriculture investment in Catalonia after attending Kiss the Ground symposium

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobbies: early-morning chess matches with team analysts; experiments with low-gravity ball physics in VR  
- Enjoys flamenco guitar; composes short pieces under the pseudonym “Xevi S.” (unreleased)  
- Guiding maxim: “Space is won with the mind before the feet touch the pitch.”  
- Fascinated by historical navigation maps; keeps a 1675 lunar cartograph framed in his study

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Moon Dinner as a test-bed for extreme-environment teamwork and communication protocols  
- Looking to discuss:  
  • Cognitive load in confined habitats vs. in-game situational awareness  
  • Incorporating lunar-gravity findings into injury-recovery programs  
- Can contribute insights on cultivating unity across multicultural crews; proven record turning heterogeneous squads into cohesive systems

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to: NASA’s Human Performance team, ESA food-systems researchers, and venture funds focused on immersive training tech  
- Offers: keynote or private workshop on “Pattern Recognition for High-Stakes Collaboration”; mentorship for founders tackling realtime spatial analytics  
- Best engagement tactic: pose a strategic puzzle (e.g., “How would you press high with a 1/6th-gravity ball?”) and let him unravel scenarios on a tablet

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Keeps public persona guarded; appreciates candid curiosity over celebrity flattery  
- Sensitive topic: ongoing media pressure around Barça financial restructuring—avoid during dinner  
- Follow-up questions for future touchpoint:  
  1. Would he pilot a Barça Academy pop-up at a lunar or Martian analog site?  
  2. Interest level in co-developing an open-source dataset from Moon-gravity sports experiments?
