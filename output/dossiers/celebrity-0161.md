- Maintains a discreet loft studio in Tribeca for painting; uses it as an East-Coast jump point to Europe
- Regular quarterly hops to London & Rome for Balboa Productions co-financing meetings

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Principal, Balboa Productions (action-drama slate with Amazon MGM and Paramount+)  
- Iconic actor-director (Rocky, Rambo, Creed); streaming hit “Tulsa King” renewed through 2026
- Growing reputation in fine-arts circles—solo exhibitions of large-scale expressionist canvases drawing six-figure bids

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Packaging “Expendables: Final Salvo” as a hybrid theatrical/streaming release for Q4 2026  
- Developing a VR “Rocky Undisputed” training simulator—seeking space-compatible motion-capture to demo micro-gravity boxing  
- Personal focus on longevity science: silent investor in ReGenesis Cellular Therapies; piloting their senolytic protocol  
- Mentoring his three daughters’ on-camera and entrepreneurial ventures; wants optional filming permits on the Moon for a short father-daughters doc segment

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Daily 5 a.m. painting ritual—claims the brush work loosens his mind before weights  
- Collects rare Panerai lunar-dial watches; fascinated by Apollo mission design language  
- Guiding belief: “The fight is won in the shadows before the spotlight ever hits”  
- Enjoys improvising Italian recipes; insists real camaraderie forms while plating food together

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a proof-of-concept set for immersive storytelling—keen to scout camera angles & light behavior in 1/6 g  
- Hopes to discuss cross-branding opportunities: Rocky VR module bundled with Planta’s social-connectivity platform  
- Brings global star power, a 120 M-follower social footprint, and the ability to turn post-event footage into viral micro-docs

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to:  
  • SpaceX Starship interior design leads (for on-board VR capture)  
  • Epic Games Unreal Engine team exploring low-gravity physics patches  
  • Longevity biotech founders interested in celebrity trial ambassadors  
- Attendees can help by sharing insights on lunar nutrition and recovery protocols—he’s curious how muscle atrophy data compare to terrestrial aging research  
- Engage him by inviting a short impromptu “kitchen brigade” moment to co-plate a dish; he lights up when teaching knife skills he learned in 1976 research for Rocky

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers first-name basis; treats “Mr. Stallone” as a distancing formality  
- Sensitive about past studio disputes over Rocky IP—avoid detailed probing unless he initiates  
- Follow-up: clarify with Planta legal whether filming rights on lunar surface can transfer to Balboa Productions  
- Unusual fact ready for the host’s prompt: he was once an usher at the American Museum of Natural History planetarium, sparking his lifelong space fascination
