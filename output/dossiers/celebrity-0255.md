- Drafting a book on post-trauma comeback psychology—publishing deal signed with Penguin Random House, release slated mid-2026  
- Personally exploring zero-gravity training implications for muscle-memory retention—sees commercial crossover for elder rehab markets  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur astrophotographer; keeps a travel-size refractor telescope and has logged 40+ deep-sky objects—“shooting stars are my between-match meditation”  
- Passionate cook of Moravian comfort dishes; experiments with dehydrated ingredients to mimic space-ration constraints  
- Guiding maxim: “Pressure is privilege—gravity that keeps your feet planted while your dreams launch.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar dinner aligns with her curiosity about how human performance adapts off-planet—great talking point around micro-gravity sports possibilities  
- Seeking dialogue on immersive fan platforms that merge VR courtside views with biometric data overlays  
- Offers star power for media amplification; willing to host an on-lunar micro-clinic demonstrating modified tennis strokes in 1/6 g  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to:  
  • SpaceX zero-g R&D team (for collaborative training trials)  
  • Netflix Sports Docs division (potential series on “First Athletes in Space”)  
  • Mental Health Innovation Hub investors aligned with her foundation  
- Attendees could help validate NeuroSwing sleeve use-cases beyond elite sport—rehab, esports, military  
- Engage her by asking about nebula photography settings or sharing favorite family recipes adapted for freeze-drying; steer clear of generic tennis chatter  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid probing the 2016 home-intrusion incident unless she raises it—remains personally sensitive  
- Prefers calm environments before public remarks; consider a quiet pre-dinner walkthrough of the observatory dome  
- Follow-up intelligence: confirm whether WTA schedule permits a 2027 off-Earth exhibition match, a concept she has floated privately to sponsors
