### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Agnes Gund

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Upper East Side, Manhattan; secondary home in Connecticut overlooking Long Island Sound
- Regular circuitry: Cleveland (family roots & Gund Foundation), Los Angeles (grandchildren & museum openings), Geneva & Abu Dhabi for global art-policy summits

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- President Emerita, Museum of Modern Art; Founder, Studio in a School & Art for Justice Fund (>$200 M in grants to date)
- Board seats: Cleveland Clinic, Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard, Ford Foundation trustee emerita
- Credited with cementing diversity benchmarks in U.S. museum acquisitions and steering landmark criminal-justice philanthropy through the sale of Lichtenstein’s “Masterpiece” (2017)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Final deployment phase of Art for Justice Fund—funneling residual capital into artist-led abolition campaigns and prison education tech
- Co-commissioning an immersive public artwork for the 2026 U.S. Semiquincentennial that spotlights climate justice
- Exploring end-of-life legacy vehicles: “Aggie Fellows” program pairing young curators with social-impact entrepreneurs
- Personal: chronicling 60 years of correspondence with under-recognized artists for an open-access digital archive

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Conversation hooks: women’s basketball (long-time NY Liberty fan), early-career Basquiat stories, sustainable architecture
- Secret hobby: sketching lunar landscapes since childhood science camp—kept in a leather-bound notebook few have seen
- Guiding mantra: “Art isn’t a luxury—it’s equipment for living” (borrows from John Dewey)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to this lunar gathering as a symbolic frontier for art’s role in society; intent on placing the first socially engaged artwork on the Moon—a light-based installation visible from Earth on solstice nights
- Aims to meet propulsion engineers and XR developers who can translate activist art into low-gravity, low-oxygen environments
- Brings four decades of curatorial expertise, deep donor networks, and a talent for securing press that reframes space exploration as a cultural as well as scientific milestone

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX R&D leads (materials for art in vacuum), Bjarke Ingels Group (lunar habitat design), Melinda French Gates (co-funding gender-equity arts initiatives)
- Attendees can assist by sharing micro-grant models for rapid-response art or offering payload space in upcoming lunar missions
- Engage her with thoughtful questions about how art can pre-empt social inequities in off-planet settlements; invite her to sketch an idea on the table napkin—she loves impromptu collaborations

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Age 88 at event date; health robust but prefers travel protocols that minimize physical strain—open to telepresence if on-site stay exceeds 48 hours
- Sensitive trigger: avoid framing her philanthropy as solely afforded by wealth; emphasize vision and risk-taking
- Follow-up queries worth preparing: status of her planned “Moonlight Justice” installation concept and whether Studio in a School can pilot a zero-gravity arts curriculum for children observing from Earth
