### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Hugh Herr

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Cambridge, Massachusetts (MIT Media Lab)
- Satellite R&D loft in Telluride, Colorado—altitude lab for human-machine adaptation
- Quarterly travel loop: Boston ⇄ Zürich (ETH bionics consortium) ⇄ Houston (NASA Bioastronautics Center)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Professor & Co-Director, MIT K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics; leads Biomechatronics Group
- Co-founder, NextStep Dynamics—commercializing neurally integrated lower-limb prostheses
- 100+ patents; Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award; TIME “Titan of Tech” 2024

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a $180 M Series B to manufacture fully implantable neuro-prosthetic ankles by 2026
- Running first human trials of “Soft-Skin Interface,” a gel-matrix socket that self-adapts in micro-gravity
- Personal ambition: summit Everest with powered legs by 2030 to prove altitude resilience of adaptive bionics
- Writing a manifesto on “Cyborg Equity” to push insurers toward covering augmentation, not just replacement

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Plays flamenco guitar nightly; claims complex rhythms help tune neural-control algorithms
- Collects vintage 19th-century prosthetic limbs—uses them as design prompts for new materials science
- Guiding credo: “The distinction between disability and possibility is a design decision.”
- Enjoys speculative fiction; working with Neal Stephenson on a short story set in a post-amputation utopia

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- On lunar surface to test how reduced gravity impacts proprioceptive feedback loops in robotic limbs
- Wants dialogue on embedding tactile sensors in EVA suits for astronauts with partial mobility
- Can offer real-time demos of the “Moon Gait” algorithm—software auto-calibrates locomotion to 1/6 g
- Seeking collaborators in haptics, regolith-resistant materials, and closed-loop neuro-signal processing

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to:
  • NASA Artemis suits division lead  
  • SpaceX Starship life-support engineering team  
  • Michelin’s high-performance materials R&D chief
- Attendees can help by sharing moon-mission data on vibration loads and dust infiltration
- Engage him with tactile objects or live problem-solving; he loves on-the-spot prototyping sketches

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Surprise angle for host’s question: He secretly designs adaptive climbing routes in VR and seeds them online under a pseudonym—few know the handle is his
- Sensitive: press often fixates on his personal disability narrative; steer chat toward future human augmentation to keep him energized
- Follow-up inquiry worth making: status of his FDA breakthrough-device application—timing could align with Planta’s experiential tech showcase in 2027
