### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Parisa Tabriz

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Mountain View & San Francisco; keeps a crash pad in Chicago to stay close to family and UIUC alma mater ties  
- Passport always in bag—regular circuits to Zürich (Google Eng HQ), Tokyo (APAC privacy councils), and Washington D.C. (advisory briefings to CISA/NASA Artemis cyber desk)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Vice President of Engineering, Google Chrome & Trusted Computing  
- Oversees ~1,200 engineers across Chrome Security, Privacy Sandbox, and the Project Zero research unit  
- Coined “Security Princess” title; renowned for translating hacker culture into big-company policy  
- Key achievements: pushed HTTPS-by-default to >95 % of global web traffic; co-authored NIST’s post-quantum transition playbook; Forbes “Top 20 Influential Tech Leaders 2024”

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Rolling out quantum-resistant TLS in Chrome Canary with a target GA of Q4 2025  
- Incubating a new initiative—“Off-World Zero”—to threat-model spaceborne habitats and interplanetary networks (early MOU with ESA & JAXA)  
- Exploring angel investments in OT/ICS security startups safeguarding life-support and energy systems  
- Personally re-learning Farsi to mentor Iranian women coders via remote bootcamps

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Plays competitive pinball; owns a restored 1980 “Black Knight” machine—claims debugging Chrome extensions honed her flipper timing  
- Collects vintage mechanical padlocks and practices lock-picking as mindfulness exercise (“tiny puzzles, immediate feedback”)  
- Guiding philosophy: “Security is compassion at scale—protect people who don’t know they’re at risk.”  
- Surprising tidbit: in college she moonlighted as a wedding cake decorator; still bakes elaborate chocolate–rosewater layer cakes for teammates’ launches

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to stress-test Planta’s lunar comms mesh and share best practices for zero-trust architecture in micro-gravity habitats  
- Seeks candid dialogue on human factors: how to keep security unobtrusive in immersive social experiences  
- Brings credibility, storytelling flair, and a hacker’s perspective that will energize media coverage of the event

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros valued:  
  • NASA Gateway Cybersecurity Lead (Lt. Col. A. Benton)  
  • VC partners at SpaceFund & Eclipse targeting space infrastructure protection  
  • Culinary technologist José Andrés for a side project on “edible encryption” pop-ups  
- Attendees can assist by sharing real-world failure stories—she loves post-mortems more than success decks  
- Engage her with hands-on demos (e.g., live packet capture from lunar Wi-Fi); avoid abstract slideware

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers direct questions over small talk; will open up if offered quality dark chocolate or access to the habitat’s control-room dashboards  
- Sensitive topic: her father’s recent health issues—do not reference publicly, but a discreet “hope your family is well” will register  
- Follow-up angle: invite her to co-author a post-event white paper on governance models for extraterrestrial networks
