### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Phil Knight

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Hillsboro, Oregon (near Nike World HQ)
- Secondary base: La Quinta, California; periodic stays in Tokyo and Hong Kong to maintain Asia-Pacific supplier ties
- Jet habit: weekly Portland–LA shuttle; quarterly Asia loops; increasing visits to Austin & Boca Chica to monitor commercial space-flight partners

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & Chairman Emeritus, Nike, Inc. (NYSE: NKE); still gatekeeps brand storytelling and bold-bet R&D budgets
- Founder, Swoosh Foundation & Animation studio LAIKA; lifetime giving >$4 B to health, sport science, and journalism programs
- Credited with globalizing athlete-driven marketing; personal net worth ~$45 B

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Championing Nike’s 2026 “Gravity Series” footwear line—bio-adaptive midsoles tuned for lunar / Martian gravities
- Finalizing a $1 B endowment to University of Oregon’s Human Performance in Space Institute (launch Q3 2025)
- Quietly evaluating minority stakes in reusable-rocket cargo services to tighten future off-planet supply chains
- Personal goal: run a symbolic 400 m lap in lunar low-grav before age 90 (“just once more around the track”)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong middle-distance runner; still logs 20 miles/week on an underwater treadmill
- Curates first editions of Japanese business classics; favorite maxim: “Hit the ground running—even when there’s less ground” (his twist on Bowerman’s mantra)
- Enjoys surprise cameo roles in LAIKA stop-motion films—voices characters under the pseudonym “Buck O.” (few outside studio know this)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Nike is outfitting Planta crew with prototype lunar-traction socks; Knight wants candid user feedback over dinner
- Seeking: chemists iterating on dust-repellent yarns, cross-industry brand storytellers, and bold chefs experimenting with metabolic-optimized cuisine
- Offers: decades of consumer-behavior insight, global athlete ambassador network, willingness to co-sponsor a Moon-based charitable fun-run livestream

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX Raptor propulsion materials team, Patagonia’s circular-textile lead, Netflix’s space-doc content head
- Attendees can assist by sharing in-situ dust abrasion data, or connecting him to ex-NASA dieticians exploring micro-greens for endurance
- Engage him: ask about the quirky Japanese exporter who shipped his first running shoes in 1963, then segue to how he intends to “sell air” on the Moon

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers rapid-fire questions; loathes formal slide decks—bring a single sample or story
- Sensitive area: publicly stepped back from daily Nike ops; avoid probing family dynamics around succession
- Follow-up: gauge enthusiasm for co-branding a commemorative “Sea of Tranquility Track” and securing first broadcast rights for a lunar 5K
