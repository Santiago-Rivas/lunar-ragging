### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Arunachalam Muruganantham

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India  
- Regular circuits: Nairobi (UN Women initiatives) & Cambridge, MA (MIT D-Lab collaboration)  
- Prefers overnight trains or economy class flights—keeps him close to “real people” he designs for

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Jayaashree Industries—creator of the world-leading low-cost sanitary-pad micro-manufacturing machine  
- Architect of the “Pad-in-a-Day” micro-franchise model now active in 34 countries  
- UNESCO-Equatorial Guinea International Prize laureate; featured in TIME 100 list of most influential people

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling a new generation of fully compostable, plant-fiber pads derived from banana pseudo-stem waste—field trials in India, Kenya, and Peru wrap up Q4 2025  
- Building an open hardware platform (“MenstruTech OS”) to let rural makers swap parts, firmware, and local biomaterials without licensing fees  
- Personal 12-month quest: prove low-gravity manufacturing can compress drying times for plant fibers—early dialogue with ISRO’s Gaganyaan life-science team  
- Ambition: shift conversation from “affordable pads” to “circular menstrual health” that feeds soil, not landfills

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Recreational beekeeper; believes hive dynamics mirror grassroots entrepreneurship—“every worker is a queen in waiting”  
- Fond of percussion; carries a compact mridangam to unwind during travel  
- Guiding philosophy: “Complexity is a sign the wrong person is designing.”  
- Surprising fact: once apprenticed as a welder for touring circus equipment—sparked his obsession with modular rigs and safety under extreme conditions

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: sustainable personal-hygiene solutions are critical for closed-loop lunar habitats; his compostable pad tech offers a lightweight, low-waste option  
- Seeks partners to test fiber-pulp dehydration in 1/6 g; interested in Planta’s sensor mesh for real-time bio-waste monitoring  
- Can contribute a compelling narrative on frugal innovation that bridges frontier tech and bottom-of-pyramid needs—resonates with event’s “uncommon commonalities” theme

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions: NASA Life Support Systems Lab, ESA Circular Bio-Economy group, Patagonia’s Tin Shed Ventures (sustainability fund)  
- Potential supporters: impact investors focusing on women’s health, lunar habitat architects needing low-mass consumables  
- Best engagement: hands-on demonstrations—offer him a small workshop table; he’ll 3-D print a pad mold on-site and spark conversation organically

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Political sensitivities: openly criticizes “tampon taxes” and pharma overpricing—avoid pairing with large consumer-goods execs without prior briefing  
- Prefers direct questions; small talk around cricket or cinema works as ice-breakers  
- Follow-up inquiry: verify timeline for his micro-gravity fiber-drying experiment—prototype readiness date will shape potential joint demos on the Moon
