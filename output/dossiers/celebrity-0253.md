### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS

- Enjoys astrophotography; travels with a collapsible 4-inch refractor—keen to capture Earthrise images during lunar evening

- Conversation wildcard: collects vintage coins from every tournament city; is bringing a 1969 Canadian silver dollar to leave on the Moon  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- As a public-facing, Gen-Z Latina-Filipina icon, she broadens the narrative of who pioneers “off-world social life”  
- Seeking dialogue on human performance metrics in micro-gravity, partnerships for testing Re-Set wearable patches on future lunar missions  
- Offers compelling media draw—ready for joint photo op in zero-G formal wear; can deliver a succinct 30-second bilingual toast about unity across borders and planets  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to: NASA Human Research Program leads, ESA Space Medicine Office, and Virgin Galactic’s payload integration team  
- Would value a sit-down with Planta’s HCI designers to co-design athlete-centric social VR modules  
- Engage her with a surprise tasting of yuzu-matcha mochi (favorite comfort treat) and ask: “What’s the smallest habit that wins the biggest match?”

- Prefers concise, actionable asks; responds well to data-backed proposals over visionary rhetoric  
- Follow-up Q for deeper rapport: “Which moon-phase best matches your pre-match mindset, and why?”
