### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Demis Hassabis

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: London (DeepMind HQ, Kings Cross)
- Satellite workspaces: Mountain View (Alphabet), Zurich AI Lab, Washington D.C. (frontier-AI policy briefings)
- Travel rhythm: 10-day cycles between UK-US; quarterly science retreats in Greece for uninterrupted ideation

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & CEO, Google DeepMind – steering >2,500-person research org toward safe, general AI
- Chair, UK Frontier AI Taskforce Advisory Board
- Recent distinctions: ACM Prize in Computing 2024; Royal Society Mullard Award for AlphaFold-enabled drug breakthroughs

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Launching “Gemini-3”—a multimodal, tool-using agent aimed at automated scientific discovery
- Standing up a 100-MW sovereign compute cluster in Northumberland with 100% renewable power
- Personal moonshot: cross-disciplinary initiative to map all protein–protein interactions by 2030
- Quietly assembling a venture studio backing neuro-inspired hardware startups; first cheques deploy Q4 2025
- Personal horizon: training for sub-orbital flight with Virgin Galactic; views zero-g as cognitive-state research opportunity

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong Go and chess aficionado; keeps a travel-size goban in carry-on
- Collects vintage arcade PCB boards—claims reverse-engineering them sharpens abstraction skills
- Practices “memory palace” drills daily; ranked top 10 in UK Memory Championships at age 16
- Guiding maxim: “Intelligence is the universe discovering itself—our duty is to keep the mirrors clean.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as live case study for AI-mediated social dynamics in extreme environments
- Wants to gauge latency constraints for autonomous science assistants running on lunar edge hardware
- Seeks collaborators for adaptive nutrition algorithms—AI-optimized menus using closed-loop hydroponics
- Offers: turnkey conversational AI concierge that can curate seatings and generate post-event insight reports within 24 hrs

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: lunar habitat architects (radiation-shielding materials), sensory-XR designers, sovereign wealth funds exploring space infrastructure
- Attendees can assist by sharing datasets on lunar regolith chemistry or human circadian metrics in low-gravity
- Engage him by proposing a micro-Go match on transparent board under moon-view dome; segue into cognition under altered perceptual inputs

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive to AGI “doom” rhetoric—prefers concrete alignment protocols over speculative fear
- Avoid probing Alphabet org charts; internal restructuring still in flux
- Suggested follow-up: invite him to co-draft a “Lunar Intelligence Manifesto” outlining AI governance for off-world settlements
