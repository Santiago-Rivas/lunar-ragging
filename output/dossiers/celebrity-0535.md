- Primary base: San Francisco Bay Area  
- Secondary footprint: Austin (DoorDash engineering hub) & Washington, DC (policy engagements)  
- Regular Asia-Pac loops—Singapore / Seoul every 8 weeks to steer non-U.S. growth; logged 260k air miles in 2024  
- Private pilot license obtained 2023; favors quick hops to test drone corridors around Mojave & West Texas

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW

- Key achievements

  • Pioneered “DashMart Autonomous” robotic dark-store network—first profitable last-mile model at scale  
  • Launched $200 M Main Street Strong initiative post-pandemic, cementing small-business goodwill

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling DoorDash’s aerial & rover fleet; 1 B autonomous deliveries target by 2027  
- Incubating “Project MoonPlate” with NASA’s Food Tech Office—closed-loop meal kits verified for lunar base use  
- Personal family goal: introduce his young daughters to Mandarin & Sichuan culinary heritage via in-home ghost-kitchen experiments  
- Standing up “Frontend Ventures” (personal fund, $150 M) to back zero-gravity cold-chain, carbon-negative packaging, and Asian diaspora food brands

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong NBA junkie; owns game-worn Steph Curry rookie jersey—easy conversation starter  
- Completed 2024 New York Marathon (3:42); runs every conference morning at 5 a.m.  
- Guiding maxim: “Intensity is the price of excellence.” (He recites it to new hires.)  
- Little-known twist: did open-mic stand-up in college—nails rapid-fire celebrity impressions and still warms up teams with one

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Critical to Planta’s lunar dinner logistics—DoorDash robots already scheduled to handle final-meter plating in the Sea of Tranquility habitat  
- Seeking collaborators on micro-gravity-safe insulation foams, bio-based utensils, and real-time sensory feedback loops for diners  
- Offers deep consumer behavior data, marketing reach (50 M MAUs), and capital for joint IP commercialization

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: ESA life-support engineers, Kimball Musk (Square Roots space farming), SoftBank Vision Fund 3 partners  
- Attendees can assist by demoing edible bioplastics or AI flavor-pairing engines; willing to sign rapid NDAs on-site  
- Best engagement: ask what street snack he’d teleport to the Moon—he lights up on childhood scallion pancakes story

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers blunt, metric-driven dialogue; 90-second story arcs win attention  
- Sensitive point: media pigeonholes him as “food-delivery guy”; steer framing toward “infrastructure for human connection”  
- Follow-up: gauge appetite for a co-produced docu-series tracking the dinner’s supply chain from Earth kitchens to lunar table
