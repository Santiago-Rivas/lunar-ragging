### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Erykah Badu

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Dallas, TX; maintains creative loft and home studio in the Deep Ellum district  
- Nomadic tour rhythm: spends ~150 days/year on the road; habitual month-long residencies in Brooklyn and Berlin for recording or art collaborations

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Singer-songwriter, producer, DJ (“Lo Down Loretta Brown”), and actress; four-time Grammy winner and widely cited “Queen of Neo-Soul”
- Founder, Badu World Market (holistic lifestyle & fragrance line); equity partner in cannabis wellness venture “Apple Trees”
- Ongoing collaborator with visual artists (Kehinde Wiley, Virgil Abloh estate) integrating music, fashion, and Afrofuturism

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Final mixes on tenth studio project “Electric Ase” slated for fall 2026; experimenting with spatial audio designed for off-Earth listening environments
- Scaling Badu World Market’s “Toone Core” scent capsules—solid-state aroma diffusers engineered for low-gravity habitats
- Developing community birthing & doula training program in South Dallas; seeking public-private funding
- Personal exploration: deepening practice in metaphysics and plant neurobiology; carving time for zero-gravity meditation research

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobbies: stone carving, mushroom foraging, and vinyl hunting (prefers 1970s Turkish psych-funk)  
- Loves questions that “bend the mind toward new fractals”; open to philosophical rabbit holes about time perception
- Guiding mantra: “Sound is a portal—frequency directs form”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Artistic lens on Afrofuturism and sonic ritual aligns perfectly with Planta’s moon-based immersion theme
- Arrives eager to test acoustic resonance in pressurized lunar modules; keen to perform a brief sound bath using crystal bowls if logistics allow
- Curious about how scent disperses in partial gravity—seeks data partners to validate Toone Core diffuser prototypes
- Offers cultural gravitas and media draw; her presence alone boosts post-event storytelling potential

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Ideal intros:  
  • Acoustic engineers working on lunar habitats  
  • Chefs experimenting with flavor perception in altered gravity  
  • VCs focused on sensory tech or wellness in space tourism
- Attendees can assist by sharing biological or psychological data sets on human emotion in isolated environments
- Engagement tips: bring a provocative vinyl-record anecdote or ask her to riff on sound vs. silence in space; avoid small talk about chart rankings

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive to synthetic lighting; prefers warmer hues—coordinate seating away from harsh LEDs
- Surprise fact she enjoys sharing: licensed doula who has delivered 50+ babies; connects birth experiences to “cosmic arrival”
- Potential follow-up: offer venue for private listening session of “Electric Ase” spatial mix—small, candle-lit dome recommended for maximum resonance
