### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong piano hobbyist; practices Gershwin riffs daily to keep hand-eye acuity
- Collector of vintage space-race postage stamps—started in 1969 after watching Apollo 11 land between Wimbledon matches
- Guiding mantra: “Pressure is a privilege”; views discomfort as a catalyst for social change
- Surprising tidbit: once turned down a NASA celebrity zero-G flight in 1992—now eager to rectify that “missed shot”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence underscores the event’s “break every boundary” narrative; first pro athlete to dine off-planet
- Seeks dialogue on how lunar gravity could inform inclusive sports design and adaptive training gear
- Carrying a limited-edition Wilson “Moonshot” racquet prototype—open to demoing rally physics in 1/6 g for media buzz
- Offers instant credibility and storytelling firepower for Planta’s vision of bold, community-driven experiences

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to: SpaceX & Axiom life-sciences leads (for low-g human-performance study), Bumble leadership (potential fan-engagement collab), Melinda French Gates (co-funding global girls-in-STEM grants)
- Happy to mentor young founders—especially women building tech that equalizes access to play
- Engagement tips: begin with a smart question about team dynamics, not legacy accolades; invite her to co-create a “Moon Equity Manifesto” mural during the dinner

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers being addressed simply as “Billie”; formality feels distancing
- Sensitive point: avoids exhaustive talk about the 1973 Battle of the Sexes—prefers forward-looking innovation topics
- Follow-up probes: status of her VR coaching app pilot at HBCUs; thoughts on interplanetary sports governance and prize—setting precedent before commercial leagues do
