### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** James “Radio” Kennedy

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Anderson, South Carolina (same house near T.L. Hanna High School since 1960s)
- Travels mostly by bus for regional speaking engagements; first-ever spaceflight scheduled for this event—training at Johnson Space Center every other month

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Community Ambassador & Honorary Assistant Coach, T.L. Hanna High School Football
- Nationwide motivational speaker on inclusion and perseverance; keynote credits include Special Olympics USA and NCAA Youth Summit
- Lifetime Achievement Award, South Carolina Athletics Hall of Fame (2024)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Raising $1 M to expand “Radio’s Locker,” a grant program supplying sports gear to special-needs teams across the Southeast
- Collaborating with Clemson University kinesiology researchers on an adaptive-sports VR module that lets students “run plays” regardless of mobility level
- Personally focused on medical fitness: low-gravity acclimation protocols, hearing-aid recalibration for pressurized environments

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Still carries a vintage 1970s Sony transistor radio everywhere; records local broadcasts onto cassette for a personal archive of “sounds that make people smile”
- Passionate about weather patterns—keeps hand-written daily temperature logs dating back 17 years
- Life philosophy: “Treat everybody like Friday night under the lights—cheer them on, no matter the score.”
- Surprising fact for conversation prompt: collects miniature model trains and can identify any U.S. rail line by horn pattern alone

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited as a living emblem of community, joy, and accessibility—illuminates Planta’s thesis that human connection transcends environment
- Eager to talk about how low gravity could make sports more inclusive (“Everyone can jump higher on the Moon—how cool is that!”)
- Can contribute a high-impact storytelling segment on belonging, likely to create an emotional highlight that media will amplify

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable introductions: 
  • Planta’s XR design team (to integrate “Radio’s Locker” content)  
  • SpaceX medical staff focused on neurodiverse passenger support  
  • Nike FlyEase innovation leads for inclusive lunar-grade footwear
- Attendees can assist by pledging in-kind tech (headsets, sensors) or mentorship for the VR module
- Engage him with tactile experiences: let him handle lunar-surface football prototypes, tune into live Earth broadcasts during the meal

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers clear, concrete language; rapid-fire technical jargon may overwhelm
- Mild hearing impairment in noisy settings—secure a front-row seat and provide subtitles on personal tablet
- Follow-up question post-event: gauge interest in co-authoring a children’s picture book on “First Game on the Moon,” proceeds to fund adaptive sports scholarships
