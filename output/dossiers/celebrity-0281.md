### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Yvon Chouinard

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Ventura, California (Patagonia HQ); maintains a modest cabin in Wyoming near the Snake River
- Annual migration pattern: winters split between Ventura surf breaks and Chilean Patagonia; summers fly-fishing across the American West and Iceland

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & former owner, Patagonia, Inc.; transferred 100 % voting stock to the Patagonia Purpose Trust (2022) to channel all profits (~$100 M/yr) into climate action
- Pioneer of “responsible business” ethos—early adopter of B-Corp status, 1 % for the Planet program, and regenerative organic supply chains

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Directing Patagonia’s philanthropic strategy toward “re-wilding” degraded lands and ocean kelp-forest revival
- Personally funding a small-batch blacksmith shop producing recyclable titanium hardware for low-impact alpine routes
- Exploring textile innovations that sequester carbon (e.g., basalt fiber, mycelium composites) with an eye on extraterrestrial applicability
- Preparing memoir “The Reluctant Industrialist, Part II” covering the post-donation transition and a call for “planetary trusteeship”

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong climber, surfer, tenkara fly-fisher; still leads 5.9 trad routes at age 87
- Self-taught blacksmith—prefers forging pitons at dawn for meditation
- Guiding maxim: “Nature has no shareholders; we are its reluctant stewards.”
- Enjoys discussing falconry and traditional Inuit kayak design—unexpected conversational curveballs
- Drinks maté out of a recycled titanium gourd; carries it everywhere as an ice-breaker

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to provide a conservation lens on lunar development—advocates “leave no trace beyond Earth”
- Interested in closed-loop waste and energy systems for off-world habitats; assessing whether Patagonia’s cradle-to-cradle models translate to space settlements
- Hopes to meet material scientists working on regolith-based fabrics and zero-water dyeing
- Can contribute storytelling gravitas on building values-driven brands and mobilizing consumer activism—even on the Moon

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • Dr. Kenji Nakamura (Regolith Textiles Lab) – potential collaboration on basalt fiber garments  
  • LunaLoop Life-Support Consortium – to compare terrestrial regenerative agriculture with lunar bioreactors  
- Attendees may assist by offering pilot projects where Patagonia grants can underwrite environmental impact audits for space initiatives
- Engaging him: skip small talk; open with a pointed question about river restoration or ask him to demonstrate the collapsible fly rod he keeps in his jacket pocket

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: increasing hearing loss in right ear—converse on his left side in quiet zones
- Prefers concise, principle-driven dialogue; dismisses corporate jargon and “exponential” hype
- Follow-up question aligned with host goal: “What’s something in your workshop right now that no one outside your inner circle has seen?” (sets up a story about experimental lunar-grade pitons)
