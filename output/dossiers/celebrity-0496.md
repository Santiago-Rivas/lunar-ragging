### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Mark Rober

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Sunnyvale, California
- Regular West-to-East shuttle between Bay Area, Houston (Johnson Space Center), and Los Angeles for studio shoots and CrunchLabs warehouse
- Quarterly “expedition blocks” (2–3 weeks on location) for large-scale builds—recently Baja desert rocket tests and a New Zealand stratospheric balloon launch

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Chief Creative, CrunchLabs Inc. (STEM subscription boxes + streaming classroom series)
- Science-edutainment YouTuber (30 M+ subscribers, 3.5 B+ views); annual “Glitter Bomb” and high-impact charity campaigns (#TeamTrees, #TeamSeas, $80 M+ raised)
- Former NASA JPL mechanical engineer—seven years on Mars Curiosity Rover EDL team

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling CrunchLabs to 1 M active subscribers by Q4 2026; negotiating curriculum partnerships with Singapore & UAE education ministries
- Producing a 90-minute streaming special: “Engineering in Lunar Gravity”—seeking authentic low-g footage to replace wire-work simulations
- Personal moonshot: patent-pending micro-turbine system that folds into a USPS flat-rate box; intends to demo it in orbit by 2028
- Exploring venture investment arm “Rober Labs Ventures” to seed hardware-forward edu-startups (ticket: $250-500 k)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Obsessive puzzle collector; keeps a secret wall of 150+ mechanical puzzles that must be solved for office lights to turn on
- Halloween fanatic—builds a new fright illusion each year purely for neighborhood kids (never posted online)
- Guiding maxim: “Trust the process, test the prototype, show the bloopers”
- Recently started freediving training; fascinated by parallels between neutral buoyancy and lunar EVA movement

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar dinner offers rare, authentic low-g environment—essential B-roll for forthcoming special
- Keen to discuss sensory-engineered cuisine: how aroma disperses at 1/6 g; potential segment on “smell rockets”
- Wants intros to Plant-based hydroponic researchers on site—possible CrunchLabs kit: “Grow lettuce like a Moon farmer”
- Brings massive amplification value: 10-minute highlight video will likely hit 20 M views in first week

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Prime introductions: Artemis crew training leads (NASA), Axiom Space R&D head, Disney Imagineering’s experiential design VP
- Attendees can help by sharing novel failure stories—he mines them for teaching moments
- Engage him with a playful challenge: design a utensil that keeps soup on the spoon in low gravity within 15 minutes—this sparks instant collaboration

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid off-brand sponsorship pitches; he rejects products not aligned with STEM or altruism
- Subtle but genuine ask: he’s searching for a children’s hospital partner to donate 100 k kits in 2027—any connections welcome
- Possible surprising fact to prompt: he spent two summers as a silent-film pianist to pay for college, still plays ragtime when unwinding
- Follow-up: confirm filming clearances—he insists on crew of four and ability to mount high-speed cameras near dining canopy
