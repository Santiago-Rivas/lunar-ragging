### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Timnit Gebru

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Oakland, California  
- Maintains apartments in Addis Ababa & Brussels for Africa-centric research and EU policy work  
- Travel cadence: monthly DC/Brussels policy loops; quarterly retreats in East Africa; deliberately avoids “tech conference carousel” unless mission-critical  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Executive Director, Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR)  
- Former co-lead, Ethical AI team at Google; catalyst for industry-wide shift toward algorithmic accountability  
- Key achievements: “Gender Shades” benchmark, co-author of landmark Stochastic Parrots paper, TIME 100 Most Influential (2022)  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a $25 M multi-year fund to triple DAIR fellows and launch an Africa-based compute cluster powered by geothermal energy  
- Drafting an “AI Environmental Impact Standard” for multilateral adoption—target release Q4 2025  
- Personal: finishing a hybrid memoir-manifesto (working title: Moral Circuits) and dusting off her long-abandoned jazz vocals for a surprise EP drop in 2026  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend ritual: traditional Eritrean coffee ceremony—roasts her own beans, fiercely opinionated about grind size  
- Long-distance cycling; completed a self-supported 500-mile Pacific Coast ride last year  
- Guiding maxim: “No technology is neutral, but every technologist can be”  
- Favorite speculative-fiction anchor: Octavia Butler’s Earthseed series—quotes “Shape God” when discussing policy flexibilities  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner’s premise as a testbed for “decolonizing space” and embedding ethics before lunar commercialism scales  
- Looking to meet:  
  • Materials scientists studying lunar resource extraction ethics  
  • Philanthropists interested in social-justice-oriented space research  
  • Chefs experimenting with closed-loop food systems for off-world habitats  
- Offers uncompromising perspective on data governance, cultural inclusivity, and environmental cost accounting for extraterrestrial tech  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: Omidyar Network’s Tech & Society portfolio, Patagonia’s climate innovation fund, ESA’s Space Ethics Board  
- Attendees can add value by sharing concrete pathways for open-data lunar research or low-carbon launch logistics  
- Engagement tip: ask for her take on building “consentful data regimes” in micro-societies; invite her to lead a brief lunar-gravity coffee pour—guaranteed ice-breaker  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: burned by corporate retaliation; avoid praising “move fast” cultures without caveats  
- Prefers candid, mission-aligned talk; will disengage from vague futurism  
- Follow-up question aligned with host’s goal: “Most people don’t know you fronted an underground techno DJ duo in Zurich—what did performing teach you about feedback loops?”
