### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Larry Ellison

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: Woodside, CA (18-acre Japanese-inspired estate) & Lanai, HI (owns 98% of the island)  
- Regular circuit: Austin & Nashville (Oracle regional hubs), Newport RI & Cagliari IT for America’s Cup prep, Tokyo for wellness-tech scouting

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder, Chairman & CTO, Oracle Corp. (NYSE: ORCL) – now >30 % of global ERP cloud market  
- Principal investor in Lanai “Sensei” longevity ecosystem; stealth stakes in SpaceX, Boom Supersonic, and two privacy-first health-record startups  
- Record four-time America’s Cup winning syndicate backer; drives cross-disciplinary R&D between sailing foil dynamics and data-center cooling

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Aggressively scaling Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen4 to compete head-on with AWS in AI model hosting; courting sovereign-cloud deals across Gulf states  
- Piloting a global longitudinal health database on Lanai—goal: integrate genomic, lifestyle, and EHR data for a 120-year lifespan playbook  
- Personal ambition: secure a seat on a private orbital mission post-2030—“won’t settle for watching the moon through a porthole”  
- Finalizing design of a net-zero, hydrogen-powered super-yacht to serve as floating R&D lab and sailing base

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Obsessed with samurai culture; collects 16th-century tsuba and quotes Musashi: “Perceive that which cannot be seen with the eye.”  
- Hobbies: competitive tennis (hits daily, even at sea), freediving off Lanai’s south shore, and late-night jazz piano improvisation—few have heard him play  
- Guiding belief: “Data, like wind, is useless unless you harness it.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees lunar dinner as perfect stress-test for ultra-low-latency OCI edge nodes supporting AR social layers—intends to probe Planta’s communications stack  
- Seeking partners to pilot closed-loop hydroponic nutrition analytics for his Lanai wellness retreats; lunar agriculture R&D is a natural overlap  
- Brings value: can underwrite mission-critical cloud & cybersecurity, supply aerospace-grade ceramic data-center materials, and amplify media reach through Oracle Red Bull Racing channels  
- Will likely drop a surprise pledge: fund a “Lunar Code Library” to preserve open-source software in deep-cold vaults beneath the Sea of Tranquility

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: NASA Gateway logistics leads, ESA life-support scientists, Patagonia Provisions (for regenerative food collab)  
- Offer to mentor early-stage founders building planetary-scale databases; open to minority checks up to $25 M for teams with proprietary telemetry from space habitats  
- Engage him by asking how foil hydrodynamics inform moon-buggy suspension—he relishes cross-domain analogies

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers brisk, contrarian dialogue—skip pleasantries and challenge his assumptions  
- Possible “surprising fact” he’ll share if prompted: he designs his own piano compositions under the pseudonym “Kenshin Mori.”  
- Follow-up areas: status of hydrogen-yacht regulatory approvals; willingness to co-host a Lanai-to-lunar telemedicine pilot after the dinner
