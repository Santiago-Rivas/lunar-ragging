### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon  

**FULL NAME:** Kevin Plank  

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Baltimore, MD (home + Under Armour HQ); secondary presence in Miami for marine-tech investments  
- Quarterly loops through Austin, Boston, and Zurich to scout performance-fabric labs and venture partners  
- Keeps a Gulfstream on standby; known for same-day coast-to-coast turnarounds when a deal or sprint demo demands face-time  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Executive Chair, Under Armour (NYSE: UA); shifted from day-to-day CEO role in 2020 but still drives product vision  
- CEO, Plank Industries—portfolio spans urban redevelopment (Baltimore Peninsula project), Sagamore Spirit rye whiskey, and data-centric logistics at Port Covington terminal  
- Key achievements: built UA to >$5 B revenue on moisture-wicking “second skin” tech; early advocate for athlete-centric data (acquired MapMyFitness, Endomondo)  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Spearheading UA’s “Project Helios”: next-gen thermal-adaptive apparel for extreme climates—testing both Arctic and simulated lunar habitats  
- Securing anchor tenants for Baltimore Peninsula innovation district; positioning it as East-Coast hub for sports-tech and bio-fabrication  
- Personal ambition: earn private astronaut wings before age 55; already logged 60+ hours in zero-G parabolic flights with Nolan Space Ventures  
- Exploring carbon-negative rye production at Sagamore Spirit to align whiskey brand with regenerative agriculture narrative  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong horse-racing enthusiast; converted Sagamore Farm from racing stable to high-precision barley research center  
- Partial to Stoic philosophy—often quotes “The obstacle is the way” to teams under pressure  
- Collects vintage naval compasses; says they remind him “direction beats speed”  
- Surprising fact he enjoys sharing: still designs and patents at least one textile innovation per year under a pseudonym to keep his inventor muscles sharp  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending to evaluate lunar-surface garment requirements and sensor integration opportunities for athletes training in reduced gravity  
- Wants candid dialogue on psychological cohesion in micro-communities—insights for both space crews and urban redevelopment  
- Brings value: deep manufacturing network, marketing storytelling mastery, and willingness to co-fund bold prototypes if they align with performance humanism  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Seeks introductions to:  
  • SpaceX Raptor thermal engineers (cross-learning for fabrics)  
  • Dr. Grace Okafor, NASA Human Factors Lab (crew cohesion research)  
  • Impact investors chasing circular-economy materials  
- Attendees can assist by providing small-batch lunar regolith samples for fiber testing or connecting him with algae-based polymer startups  
- Best engagement tactic: present a tangible challenge (“How would you keep muscles firing on day-20 of low-gravity?”); he instinctively ideates solutions on napkins  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid small talk on UA’s past accounting probes—he considers the matter closed  
- Prefers standing conversations; will gravitate toward windows or viewports  
- Follow-up Q after the event: gauge his interest in co-hosting a zero-G hackathon at Baltimore Peninsula prior to 2027 launch window
