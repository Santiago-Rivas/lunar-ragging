### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Nick Kyrgios

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Canberra, Australia; maintains training pads in Miami and Dubai to stay near ATP swing routes  
- Known for abrupt “micro-camps”: 3–5 day bursts in remote locations (Queenstown, Iceland) to reset mentally before big tournaments  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Professional tennis player, peak ATP #13; 2022 Wimbledon finalist and 2023 Australian Open doubles champion  
- Founder, NK Foundation—converts unused sports facilities into free youth centers  
- Minority owner, South East Melbourne Phoenix (NBL); early investor in e-sports org “Wildcard Gaming”  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Rehabbing right wrist post-surgery, targeting full-court return for 2026 Grand Slam season  
- Building “ServeBot,” a performance-analytics platform using LIDAR to map serve mechanics for junior players  
- Negotiating content series with Netflix on the psychology of elite competitors in isolation (pitch references potential off-Earth episodes)  
- Personally exploring venture stakes in sustainable travel and zero-gravity fitness equipment  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong NBA fanatic—memorizes obscure 1990s Celtics stats; plays midnight pickup wherever he lands  
- Hardcore gamer (Call of Duty, Valorant); streams anonymously under a handle only close friends know  
- Compulsively collects limited-edition sneakers and vintage Pokémon cards—values authenticity over resale hype  
- Guiding philosophy: “Raw beats polished—people connect to imperfections.” Uses this to disarm critics and inspire youth  
- Surprising fact he rarely shares: has logged 42 hours toward a private pilot’s license, finds cockpit routines soothing for anxiety management  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn by the sheer novelty of a social gathering in low gravity—already joking about landing a tweener shot across the dining hall  
- Wants to discuss mental performance in extreme environments, and how Planta’s tech could assist athlete recovery in transit to lunar or orbital events  
- Could offer a live demo of reaction-time drills adapted for 1/6 g, creating viral media for the event’s post-coverage  
- Interested in connecting his Foundation to moon-based STEM learning content for underserved kids on Earth  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros sought to: SpaceX commercial partnerships team; Nike’s ISPA research group exploring extraterrestrial footwear; NBA Creative Tech Lab  
- Attendees can assist by beta-testing ServeBot in unconventional settings (e.g., lunar tennis pop-up) and providing biometric data  
- Engage him with quick-fire challenges (trivia, trick-shot bets); avoid lengthy podium speeches—he thrives on spontaneous energy  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Openly discusses mental health; prefers candid, stigma-free dialogue—avoid patronizing sympathy  
- Sensitive to topics of ATP fines and media controversies; steer clear unless he initiates  
- Follow-up Qs: status of pilot license exam; interest level in co-producing a “Gravity-less Games” charity exhibition after this dinner
