**FULL NAME:** Shakira Mebarak

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Current base: Miami, FL, with extended stays in Barcelona to co-parent her two sons  
- Maintains Caribbean “reset weeks” in Barranquilla every quarter; studio residencies in Los Angeles & London  
- Accepts no more than two consecutive overnight flights—relies on a circadian-optimized travel routine designed by her sports-science team  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW

- Early investor/adviser to SoundwaveXR (immersive concert streaming) and two health-tech startups targeting vocal-cord longevity  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Final mixes for bilingual concept album “Luna y Raíces” (Q4 2025 release), thematically tied to space, ancestry, and gravity  
- Planning a 2026–27 “Zero G World Tour” with mixed-reality stagecraft; negotiating with SpaceX for a micro-gravity video shoot  
- Scaling Pies Descalzos’ new AI-driven literacy app to MENA regions; seeking culturally aligned partners  
- Personal goal: complete private pilot license before 2026 to better understand flight dynamics for future aerial performances  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong astronomy nerd; owns a 16-inch Dobsonian telescope and tracks lunar libration “for songwriting cadence”  
- Multilingual polyglot (Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, Italian, basic Arabic); fascinated by how language intonation maps to dance rhythms  
- Keeps a Lebanese-Colombian recipe journal—swears by rose-petal kibbeh as pre-show meal  
- Guiding maxim: “Motion is memory—if the body feels wonder, the mind will remember the message.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as proof-of-concept for artistic performance beyond Earth; scouting feasibility of debuting the first Moon-filmed music video  
- Intends to discuss cognitive effects of low gravity on creativity with neuroscientists in attendance  
- Offers to curate an impromptu vocal layering demo using lunar acoustics to illustrate cross-cultural harmony  
- Looking for co-designers of an educational VR module that lets students on Earth “attend” the dinner in real time  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES

- Attendees can help by sharing zero-latency communication tech or school-ready VR hardware donations  
- Best engagement: ask what non-music artifact she’d bury in a Moon time capsule—triggers her passion for legacy and education  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
