### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Dr. Kizzmekia “Kizzy” Shanta Corbett

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Cambridge, MA (Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health)
- Maintains week-a-month residency in Nairobi to oversee East Africa vaccine-access pilot
- Regular shuttle Boston ⇄ Washington, D.C. for NIH advisory meetings; accepts most speaking invites only if bundled with lab-site visits

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Associate Professor of Immunology and Vaccinology, Harvard; leads Corbett Lab for Viral Immunopathogenesis
- Co-inventor of the NIH/Moderna mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine; MacArthur “Genius” 2024 Fellow
- Founding CSO, HelixNova Bio (stealth-mode spin-out developing room-temperature-stable mRNA platforms)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Fast-tracking a pan-coronavirus “shield” vaccine—Phase I enrolling Q3 2025
- Building HelixNova’s micro-freeze-drying plant in Kigali to prove end-to-end African manufacture by 2026
- NASA-funded study: immune modulation under fractional gravity; early murine results suggest T-cell cytokine drift after 14 days in lunar-sim habitat
- Personal: carving weekly “quiet hours” to finish memoir-scientific hybrid book, working title “Blueprints for Immunity”

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate gospel choir alto; organizes impromptu harmonies at conferences
- Habitual “lab kitchen” experimenter—designs molecular gastronomy desserts to mirror protein folding
- Guiding maxim: “Equity is a design parameter, not an afterthought.”
- Keeps a private collection of vintage Apollo mission patches—sees parity between vaccine roll-outs and space missions: both require “systems-level logistics woven with public trust”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- On the Moon to brief guests on immune health considerations for off-world living and showcase HelixNova’s gravity-agnostic mRNA stabilizer
- Aims to meet tech visionaries exploring closed-loop agricultural systems; curious how plant-produced biologics could pair with mRNA formulations
- Offers infectious-disease risk-mitigation frameworks for extraterrestrial habitats; can translate complex biology into engaging dinner-table stories

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intro wishes: SpaceX Life Sciences lead; Emirates Mars Mission’s medical officer; Patagonia’s Philanthropy Lab for climate-health grant alignment
- Could benefit from Planta’s social-sensor platform to capture anonymized post-vaccine symptom data in low-gravity
- Engage her with questions about bridging STEM education gaps—she travels with a pocket VR demo for “Cell Biology in Micro-G” outreach

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers direct, mission-oriented dialogue; allergic to corporate buzzwords
- Sensitive point: tired of being “tokenized” as pandemic hero—steer conversation toward future science, not 2020 retrospectives
- Follow-up: confirm if lunar facility can provide BSL-2 wet-bench corner for live-demo RNA reconstitution (she’s eager but needs clearance)
