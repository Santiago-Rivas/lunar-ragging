### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Coco Gauff

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Miami, FL; core training block at USTA campus, Orlando
- Annual circuit loops: Europe (clay/grass swing Apr–Jul), Asia (post-US Open), off-season altitude camps in Chile’s Atacama Desert
- Enjoys “stealth” long-weekend city visits for street-photography shoots—often unannounced on social media

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Current World No. 2, WTA; 2024 US Open and 2025 Australian Open champion
- Founder, Gauff Ventures – early-stage fund backing female-led sports-tech (portfolio: Kinexon wearable AI, Flowstate mental-fitness app)
- Global ambassador deals: New Balance, Barilla, Rolex; newest partnership with SpaceX-backed Starlink for “connectivity without borders” athlete initiative

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Designing micro-gravity tennis experiment to film ahead of 2027 lunar broadcast—a proof-of-concept for space-fitness content
- Scaling “Serve It Forward Foundation” from 15 to 40 U.S. inner-city programs, adding a compulsory intro-to-coding module
- Personal R&D: testing VR match-simulation goggles; exploring plant-protein recovery lines for reduced carbon footprint
- Carving out studio time to record first percussion-driven EP; sees music as mental-health release before LA 2028 Olympics push

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate street-photographer (shoots 35 mm Leica M6); moonlight landscapes fascinate her—keeps a private portfolio titled “Dark-Side Glow”
- Self-taught drummer; cites Questlove as rhythm mentor and would “trade one Grand Slam for a backstage jam with The Roots”
- Guiding mantra: “Pressure is a privilege—curiosity turns it into play” (has it engraved on her racquet throat)
- Devours Afrofuturist literature (Octavia Butler, Nnedi Okorafor) for creative reset on long flights

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence underscores event theme of human performance and culture beyond Earth
- Intent: test real-time biometric tracking suit in lunar gravity; scout culinary partners for athlete-friendly low-water crops in space habitats
- Eager to brainstorm with technologists on immersive fan experiences—holographic courtside seats projected from Moon to Earth
- Offers magnetic narrative for media package: “First Grand Slam champion to practice a serve on the Moon”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Dr. Mei Tan (Caltech lunar-agriculture lead)  
  • David Hall (Virgin Galactic, zero-g sports concepts)  
  • Chef Massimo Bottura (food waste–negative fine dining, potential collab with Barilla)
- Attendees can assist with: sponsorship architecture for 2027 space-fitness docuseries; sourcing recycled-fiber pressure suits sized for elite female athletes
- Engagement tip: open with gear talk—ask which camera body she sneaked into her flight kit; segue into how she frames “perspective shifts” on and off court

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers candid, hype-free conversation—“tell me what excites you, not your title”
- Recent quiet transition: father Corey now strategic advisor only; new coach partnership still under wraps—avoid on-record probing
- Follow-up areas: confirm availability for pre-event micro-gravity rehearsal at Houston training pool; explore if her foundation would co-sponsor a youth VR watch-party during the lunar dinner live-stream
