- Keeps a running list of “future-of-sport” ideas—e.g., zero-gravity doubles exhibition inside a SpaceX Starship hangar  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Dinner Party as proof-of-concept for social & athletic experiences beyond Earth; keen to test how community bonds form in off-planet settings  
- Looking to swap insights on microgravity nutrition, recovery protocols, and how taste buds shift in space (relevant to athlete meal design)  
- Brings: elite perspective on human performance, an approachable public persona, and media magnetism that amplifies Planta’s message to a mainstream audience  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros sought to: SpaceX Mission Ops team (lunar exhibition match logistics), Adidas FutureLab (spacewear collaboration), and leading neuroscientist Dr. Sinead Gupta (sensory adaptation research)  
- Attendees can help by sharing data on circadian regulation in lunar habitats and access to high-fidelity XR capture studios for GravityServe content  
- Engage her with tactile demos—e.g., taste-bud alteration lab or low-g reaction-time games; she favors experiential over slide decks

- Small talk starter: ask about her sourdough’s “travel passport” stamped at every tournament venue
