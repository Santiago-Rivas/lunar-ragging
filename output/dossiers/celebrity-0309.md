### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Cher Wang

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Taipei, Taiwan; maintains an apartment in Palo Alto for West-coast deal flow  
- Regular quarterly circuits through Shenzhen, Seattle, and Zürich to oversee XR component partners and AI research alliances  
- Known for unannounced “field trips” to emerging-market maker spaces—keeps her close to grassroots experimentation  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & Chair, HTC & VIA Technologies; current executive focus on HTC’s VIVERSE spatial-computing platform  
- Architect of the original Android phone (HTC Dream) and early champion of 4G chipsets at VIA  
- Holds >150 patents; ranked top 3 most influential women in global consumer tech by Fast Company (2024)  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Leading HTC’s 2025 spin-out of a lightweight XR headset built for low-gravity environments; prototyping underway with ESA consultants  
- Building a $300 M venture fund (“New Horizons Capital”) targeting edge AI, satellite networking, and regenerative manufacturing  
- Personally spearheading Faith In Love Foundation’s initiative to provide VR classical-music curricula to under-resourced schools in Southeast Asia  
- Mapping a supply-chain shift to 80 % renewables by 2028—pressure-testing lunar regolith-based 3-D printing for structural parts  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Accomplished pianist; schedules private practice at odd hours—piano access on the Moon would be an irresistible talking point  
- Enjoys ancient Chinese calligraphy; applies the discipline’s “emptiness and stroke” concept to product interface design  
- Guiding belief: “Technology should reveal human dignity, not replace it.”  
- Curious about biblical references to the cosmos—likes weaving scripture into future-of-space discussions  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees The First Dinner Party on the Moon as a living laboratory for frictionless social XR; aims to capture sensory data to refine VIVERSE’s haptic layer  
- Wants candid feedback on her prototype “Luna-Link” AI assistant—designed to translate emotional cues across language barriers in microgravity  
- Brings expertise in miniaturized edge processors, radiation-hardened VR optics, and experiential design—can advise on integrating immersive tech into Planta’s lunar venues  
- Looking for co-development partners willing to pilot hardware in 2027-2028 Artemis support missions  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought: SpaceX Starlink engineering leads, JAXA’s Moon base habitat team, and LVMH’s experiential retail lab (for XR-enabled luxury pop-ups)  
- Attendees could help by sharing real-time biometric data during dinner to stress-test Luna-Link; opt-in bracelets pre-synced to VIVERSE cloud  
- Best engagement tactic: invite her to co-sketch a “Moon-to-Earth empathy corridor” on a napkin—she loves white-board ideation, even improvised  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: prefers not to dwell on HTC’s smartphone market share decline—frame questions around “lessons for next-gen devices” instead  
- Follow-up angle: ask whether New Horizons Capital will include a dedicated “space-for-good” fund tranche—rumored but unannounced  
- Keep sessions concise; she gauges people quickly and disengages from overlong pitches—come with a single, compelling ask or insight
