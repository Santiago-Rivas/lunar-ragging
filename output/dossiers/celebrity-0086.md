### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Imogen Heap

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: “Hideaway Studio,” converted Victorian townhouse in Camden, London  
- Secondary base: Rural family home in Essex for retreat writing sessions  
- Travel pattern: Quarterly hops to L.A. for sync work, bi-monthly Berlin visits for wearable-tech R&D; keeps a standing open ticket to Singapore for Asian tech-arts residencies  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Grammy-winning songwriter-producer; catalog includes global hit “Hide and Seek,” scores for Harry Potter & Taylor Swift collaborations  
- Founder & CEO, Mi.Mu Gloves—gesture-controlled wearables used by Ariana Grande, Hans Zimmer live orchestra, and NASA’s SoundLab pilots  
- Pioneer of “Mycelia” music-blockchain platform; architect behind the Creative Passport standard now adopted by 18K+ independent artists  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scoring a mixed-reality Broadway show that requires real-time audience-driven stems; premiere slated for Q4 2026  
- Closing Series A extension (£8 M) for Mi.Mu to miniaturize glove sensors for mainstream AR/VR creators  
- Personal: Composing a “sleep concerto” for her 10-year-old daughter’s lucid-dream research; plans to release as a generative NFT album in early-2027  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Builds micro-green eco-towers in her Camden studio—talks about “sonic photosynthesis,” claiming plants modulate synth patches  
- Fan of liminal architecture; collects ISS interior schematics to inspire reverb algorithms  
- Guiding mantra: “Technology should feel like breath—present, invisible, and empowering.”  
- Little-known quirk: Travels with a 19-note kalimba tuned to 432 Hz; uses it to test unfamiliar acoustic spaces before soundcheck  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Perfect candidate to design ambient-gravity soundscapes for The First Dinner Party on the Moon; interested in how low-pressure atmospheres modify overtone series  
- Hopes to meet propulsion engineers to discuss converting cabin vibration data into rhythmic accompaniment  
- Offers to live-code a collective lunar lullaby using guests’ biometric data streamed from smart wearables during dinner  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to:  
  • ESA acoustics division (Dr. Valentina Rizzo) to co-author a “Lunar Acoustic Ecology” paper  
  • Epic Games Metahuman team for glove integration into UE6 social worlds  
- Attendees can help by sharing proprietary habitat sound data or micro-delay algorithms for extreme echo conditions  
- Engage her by asking about plant-controlled MIDI rigs or the ethics of AI-generated vocals—she will open up instantly  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid casual references to “AI replacing artists”; she is vocal about co-creative rather than substitutive AI  
- Prefers meetings in motion—suggest a slow walk along the lunar observation corridor instead of a sit-down  
- Follow-up: Invite her to beta-test Planta’s “Holo-Heartbeat” social codec inside Mi.Mu firmware update in summer 2026
