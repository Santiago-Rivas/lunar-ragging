**FULL NAME:** Ed Sheeran

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Framlingham, Suffolk, UK (restored estate with on-site recording barn)
- Maintains crash pads in Brooklyn and Nashville for songwriting sprints
- Tour routing pattern: alternating 6-week global stadium blocks with 3-week home resets to maximize family time

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Singer-songwriter & producer; 200 M+ records sold, four Grammy Awards, consistent top-grossing world tours
- Partner, Gingerbread Man Records (Atlantic JV) – incubates emerging UK & Irish acts
- Recent foray into immersive media: minority stake in MelodyVerse, a Web-XR concert platform

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Writing cycle for 2026 concept album that blends folk melodies with spatial-audio production; studio tests underway with Dolby Atmos team
- Developing “Tour-Lite” initiative: carbon-negative staging, modular solar rigs, and AI-optimised freight logistics aimed at 2027 stadium run
- Personal: expanding orchard-to-cider microbrand on Suffolk farm; proceeds earmarked for music-education grants
- Quietly exploring children’s book series inspired by bedtime songs composed for his daughters (publisher conversations Q4 2025)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong Lego builder; designs stage layouts in Lego before CAD—happy to show photos on phone
- Fascination with acoustics in unconventional spaces (caves, cathedrals, now lunar habitats); believes “every room writes a chord”
- Morning ritual: hand-brews specialty Kenyan peaberry coffee—travels with compact AeroPress kit
- Reads Marcus Aurelius; keeps a pocket notebook of daily stoic reflections

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to lunar acoustics experiment: curious whether reduced gravity alters vocal resonance and string sustain; would love a 30-second impromptu performance to test
- Seeking dialogue on integrating haptic feedback suits for remote concertgoers—Planta’s tech demos perfectly aligned
- Could contribute an exclusive Moon-recorded track for event recap media, amplifying global attention
- Wants to trade notes on sustainable off-world agriculture for possible cider apple cultivars in controlled lunar biomes

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions to: 
  • Planta’s XR engineering lead (concert interactivity)  
  • SpaceX Starlink content partnership team (live satellite broadcast rights)  
  • Michelin-level gastro-chemist on menu design (sound-taste pairings experiment)
- Attendees can assist by sharing insights on closed-loop energy systems relevant to Tour-Lite
- Engage him with a hands-on demo: place a capo-equipped travel guitar in the habitat and invite quick collaboration

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive to intrusive smartphone filming; ensure AV crew clears short acoustic moment beforehand
- Prefers informal, pun-laden conversation—opening joke referencing his song “Shivers” in lunar chills lands well
- Follow-up probe: availability to mentor Planta-sponsored music-tech fellows in 2026 cohort
