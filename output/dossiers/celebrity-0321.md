### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Pierre Omidyar

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Honolulu, Hawaiʻi (off-grid, solar-powered estate overlooking Maunalua Bay)  
- Secondary bases: Washington, DC (Democracy Fund HQ) & Paris (family and arts patronage)  
- Travel rhythm: Alternates two-month “deep work” stretches in Hawaiʻi with short, high-impact trips to civic-tech hubs (SF, D.C., Berlin); quarterly wellness retreats in Bhutan

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder, eBay (market cap ≈ $45 B); stepped back from board 2020  
- Founding benefactor, Omidyar Network (>$5 B deployed in responsible tech, global governance, and digital rights)  
- Executive Chair, First Look Media / The Intercept; back-channel adviser to investigative journalists and whistle-blower defense teams  
- Recognized architect of modern peer-to-peer trust systems; UN “Champion for Digital Democracy” (2024)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Building a $250 M “TrustStack” initiative—open-source protocols for reputation, identity, and dispute resolution in frontier markets (Web3, orbital stations, lunar commerce)  
- Accelerating climate resilience ventures in Pacific Island nations; pilot micro-insurance using satellite data launches Q3 2025  
- Personally researching silence-based meditation practices; seeking neuroscience partners to measure prolonged lunar quietude effects  
- Quiet ambition: curate a permanent space-borne art archive (“Messages to the Next Civilization”) by 2030

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Avid paraglider; maps coastal thermals using self-written data-logging firmware  
- Collects micro-fossils and meteorite fragments—fascinated by the continuity between deep time and deep space  
- Guiding philosophy: “Systems cultivate behavior; fix the system, not the symptom.”  
- Surprising tidbit to elicit: once funded a covert translation team to rescue endangered Polynesian lullabies (only family and two archivists know)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a living lab for off-world social contracts and commerce rituals—precisely the environment TrustStack hopes to serve  
- Wants candid dialogue on provenance tracking for materials used in space habitats (ethical extraction, blockchain audit trails)  
- Brings two assets: decades of community-scale trust building and an investor network eager for “mission-driven moonshots”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to:  
  • ESA’s Lunar Resource Utilization team (for standards collaboration)  
  • Chef-scientist partnerships exploring closed-loop food systems (possible micro-grant)  
  • Narrative designers creating participatory storytelling in zero-G  
- Offer to mentor early venture builders on embedding reputational feedback loops from day one  
- Engaging tactics: pose big-picture questions, then drill into code-level mechanics; he enjoys toggling between macro vision and API specs

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers intimate, low-light settings; crowded spotlight stages drain him  
- Avoid “billionaire” labels—frames himself as “systems hacker”  
- Post-event follow-up: gauge interest in co-hosting a lunar governance symposium at Hawaiʻi’s lava-tube analog facility  
- Potential red flag: deeply skeptical of purely commercial space tourism; ensure conversation emphasizes purpose over spectacle
