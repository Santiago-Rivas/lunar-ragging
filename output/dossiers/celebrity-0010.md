### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** RAY DALIO

---
### IDENTITY & BASE

- Chair, Dalio Family Office & Dalio Philanthropies; creator of the “PrinciplesOS” decision-making software
- Landmark works: “Principles,” “The Changing World Order,” translated into 30+ languages; 11 M copies sold

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Final edits on new book tracing frontier cycles—from Age of Discovery to space settlement—slated for Q4 2026
- OceanX expansion: commissioning hybrid sea-space habitat prototypes; exploring algae-based life-support tech transferable to lunar bases
- Scaling PrinciplesOS into a subscription SaaS for institutional investors and policy planners
- Personal objective: secure an on-orbit data partnership to test macro-economic models against real-time lunar market indicators

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Daily transcendental meditation; attributes “clear-headed risk assessment” to the practice
- Certified submersible pilot; logs deep-sea dives to 1,000 m—draws parallels between abyssal and extraterrestrial environments
- Plays jazz drums; enjoys impromptu jam sessions as ice-breakers
- Guiding maxim: “Pain + reflection = progress.” Sees adversity as data, not drama

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar dinner exemplifies the next ‘great frontier’ chapter in his forthcoming book—expects to gather first-hand sociological notes
- Seeks dialogue on: governance frameworks for off-world settlements, lunar commodity-exchange concepts, and regenerative life-support systems
- Brings 40 years of macro-cycle analysis, capital-raising credibility, and a ready philanthropic vehicle for space-relevant R&D

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value introductions: 
  • Heads of UAE and Singapore sovereign funds (co-investors in frontier infrastructure)  
  • Lead engineers at SpaceX Starship life-support team  
  • Any historian/anthropologist documenting early lunar culture
- How attendees can assist: share datasets on closed-loop farming, propose pilot projects that bridge ocean and lunar habitats, offer beta access to lunar economic simulations
- Engaging him: open with an unexpected historical parallel; invite him to try a VR visualization of 500-year economic waves mapped onto lunar trade routes

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Conversation hook for host’s goal: ask about his teenage stint as a NYC jazz-club bouncer—rarely publicized and yields colorful stories on risk, crowd dynamics, and early pattern recognition
- Avoid partisan U.S. politics; more receptive to systems-level, non-ideological framing
- Follow-up after event: personal assistant (Lisa Smith) handles schedule; secure 30-minute debrief to discuss potential OceanX-Planta joint study on algae-based air recycling
