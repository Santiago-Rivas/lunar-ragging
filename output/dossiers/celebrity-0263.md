### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Martina Navratilova

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: Miami, FL (winter) & Aspen, CO (summer altitude training, mountain biking)
- Predictable annual circuit: London (June – July for Wimbledon commentary), Prague visits every spring to see extended family, frequent NYC stops for board meetings and media tapings

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Legendary tennis champion: 59 Grand Slam titles across singles, doubles, mixed; pioneer of aggressive serve-and-volley style
- Lead analyst, Tennis Channel & BBC Sport; widely regarded as the most incisive on-air strategist
- Board/advisory roles: WHO Physical Activity Taskforce, SportsTech Ventures Fund, Athlete Ally; invests in motion-capture coaching platforms

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Co-developing “Zero-G Racket Science,” a VR & motion-capture training suite aimed at preparing athletes for low-gravity sports (soft-launched Q4 2024, Series A closing this summer)
- Drafting second memoir focused on reinvention, longevity, and surviving two cancer battles—target publication late 2026
- Campaigning for elite-athlete health transparency standards (wearable data ownership, post-career medical coverage)
- Personal bucket-list: hit the first backhand volley on extraterrestrial soil; training with NASA biomechanists to model ball physics on the Moon

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur astrophotographer; spends predawn hours in Aspen capturing deep-sky objects with a custom robotic telescope rig
- Lifelong dog lover; fosters rescue beagles—often names constellations after them
- Guiding philosophy: “Pressure reveals character—embrace it, or it exposes you.”
- Surprising tidbit: maintains a vintage pinball collection (25 machines) and can still repair solid-state boards by hand

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Draw for attendees: globally recognized icon who embodies peak human performance, reinvention, and boundary-pushing—perfect foil for “life beyond Earth” narrative
- Seeks dialogue on microgravity biomechanics, mental toughness in extreme environments, and equitable access to future off-world sports
- Happy to offer a live-demo of VR lunar tennis or moderate a rapid-fire panel on “Sport as the Universal Language”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros requested to: SpaceX human-performance team, Adidas FutureLab (lunar footwear prototypes), and any VC funds targeting athletic tech for space tourism
- Attendees could assist with: data on lunar surface material science for bounce dynamics; cross-disciplinary partners to co-author a white paper on first lunar sport exhibition
- Best engagement approach: present a rigorously defined challenge (e.g., “How do we standardize net height on uneven regolith?”); she gravitates to problem-solving conversations more than accolades

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Plant-forward eater but flexible—prefers whole-food options; allergic to shellfish
- Energetic yet values punctuality—conclude meetings on time
- Follow-up questions: (1) Would she lend her name to a charitable “Moon Rally” exhibition benefitting cancer survivorship? (2) Level of interest in equity stake vs. ambassador role for Zero-G Racket Science partnerships
