**FULL NAME:** Howard Schultz

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Seattle waterfront condo overlooking Elliott Bay
- Secondary residences: Manhattan (Upper West Side pied-à-terre) and Sun Valley, ID mountain retreat
- Travel rhythm: Monthly hops to Milan for espresso culture “re-immersion,” quarterly visits to Rwanda & Colombia tied to coffee-farm initiatives

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Executive Chairman, Schultz Family Office & Foundation (>$4 B AUM)  
- Former CEO & Chairman, Starbucks (took chain from 11 stores to 30 k+ worldwide)
- Key achievements:
  • Pioneered U.S. third-place café concept and universally adopted stock-option program for hourly workers  
  • Architect of Starbucks’ 2024 net-zero supply-chain roadmap  
  • Author of four leadership bestsellers; perennial guest lecturer at Stanford GSB

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Incubating “Onda Regenerative Coffee,” a farmer-owned cooperative supplying climate-resilient arabica hybrids
- Quietly seeding a $250 M “Future of Third-Place” venture fund—focus: spatial computing, experiential dining, and off-world hospitality
- Finalizing memoir-plus-manifesto: “Servant Capitalism—Leading Beyond Earth” (Penguin 2026)
- Personal ambition: run all six Abbott World Marathon Majors before age 75 (has completed three)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Avid collector of vintage La Marzocco lever machines; travels with a 1956 model for pop-up tastings
- Daily 5 a.m. meditation; cites Epictetus: “We are what we repeatedly do”
- Believes the next prestige beverage ritual will be “gravity-free extraction” in orbital cafés
- Enjoys pickup basketball; was once a Madison Square Garden ball boy—still keeps a 1970 Knicks warm-up jacket in office

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a live R&D lab for lunar hospitality and sensory design
- Wants candid dialogue on cultivating coffee plants in sealed bioregenerative life-support systems—looking for botanists and materials scientists
- Offers value: decades of scaling café experiences, brand storytelling, and supply-chain ethics; willing to supply an experimental “moon roast” for tasting

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to:  
  • SpaceX Starship life-support agronomy crew  
  • Celebrity chef Dominique Crenn (for potential zero-gravity café menu)  
  • Allianz Climate Fund re: blended finance for smallholder farmers
- Attendees can assist by sharing VR/AR platforms that simulate social “third places” in low-gravity
- Engage him over a side demo: hand-pulled espresso vs. ultrasonic extraction in 1/6 g—he loves tactile comparisons

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Politically cautious after 2019 independent exploratory run—avoid partisan angles
- Prefers direct, purpose-driven conversation; keep small talk minimal
- Prime ice-breaker for host’s question: Ask about the Knicks ball-boy era—leads naturally to themes of aspiration & unlikely journeys
