### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jackie Chan

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Hong Kong island compound; secondary apartment in Beijing’s CBD  
- Regular circuits: Los Angeles (studio deals), Singapore (philanthropy galas), Abu Dhabi (film fund consulting)  
- Happiest in transit—maintains a personal Gulfstream but still books commercial flights to “stay connected with everyday travelers”  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Chairman, JC Group (film production, stunt-team management, real estate, green tech investments)  
- 200+ films, estimated 10 B global box-office; Oscar Lifetime Achievement (2016); UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador  
- Pioneered the “outtake culture” that humanized stunt work and set global safety standards adopted by SAG-AFTRA and the China Film Bureau  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Pre-production of a hybrid live-action/VR feature “Lunar Drunken Master,” planned to shoot partial sequences in simulated 1/6 g—actively scouting tech partners  
- Scaling the Jackie Chan Stunt Scholarship (now 78 students) with a zero-gravity training module in partnership with China’s CMSA  
- Lobbying Hong Kong’s legislature for a green-film tax credit; JC Group adding solar studios in Shenzhen by Q4 2026  
- Personal: compiling a Cantonese folk-song album for release on his 73rd birthday; daily vocal training at sunrise  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects Qing-dynasty opera masks; travels with a 3D-printed replica to spark conversations  
- Early riser; practices calligraphy to sharpen finger dexterity—quotes his Peking-opera master: “Ink steadies the punch.”  
- Loves improv cooking; insists every stunt team member learn one signature dish to “taste trust.”  
- Unpublicized: holds a glider pilot license—wants to experience thermals on the lunar surface “even if they’re imaginary.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Iconic, cross-cultural storyteller aligns with Planta’s mission of boundary-free connection  
- Seeking dialogue on:  
  • Safe choreography in confined, low-gravity spaces  
  • Embedding narrative AR layers into real-time dining experiences  
  • Philanthropic tie-in—auctioning a lunar-shot short film to fund Earth reforestation  
- Brings global media draw; willing to film a behind-the-scenes reel to amplify the event’s reach (est. 120 M combined followers)  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: SpaceX cinematic team, ESA nutrition scientists, Netflix Asia-Pac Originals VP  
- Offers master-class pop-ups for attendees’ brands on kinetic storytelling in zero-g  
- Best engagement: ask about the secret stunt he rehearses in hotel corridors (balancing a porcelain teacup while cartwheeling)—preps intimacy and laughter  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid deep dives into past on-set injuries—prefers forward-looking safety talk  
- Sensitive to political framing of Hong Kong/Mainland relations; keep topics cultural or environmental  
- Follow-up query worth posing: would he donate a custom stunt-rig to Planta’s lunar base to seed an annual creative arts residency?
