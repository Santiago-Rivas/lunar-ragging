### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Palmer Luckey

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Costa Mesa, California (Anduril HQ/experimental labs)
- Bi-weekly hops to Washington, D.C. and Austin for DoD briefings and congressional tech caucus meetings
- Recently added Tokyo–Seoul rotation to court Indo-Pacific defense partners

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder, Anduril Industries — $9 B valuation; autonomous defense platforms, AI-driven sensor networks, counter-UAS systems
- Best known for founding Oculus VR (acquired by Facebook for $2 B, 2014); still retains deep network inside Meta Reality Labs
- 2024 Presidential Innovation Fellow (civil-military dual-use tech focus)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling “Menace” program: satellite-to-drone mesh that blankets contested airspace with real-time computer-vision targeting
- Quietly incubating a spin-out building ultra-light cryogenic VR haptics — aims to demo at the 2026 LA Olympics
- Personal mission: push U.S. industrial base to reclaim electronics manufacturing; scouting Midwest fabs
- Carving out time for a memoir on “garage-level moonshots” — wants stories, not ghostwriting polish

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend obsession: retro pinball restoration; sources parts from defunct Jersey warehouse
- Collects decommissioned military tech (owns a full F-5 cockpit) to remind teams that “hardware wins wars”
- Guiding line: “If it feels science-fiction, build it to make it history.”
- Normally teetotal but will taste experimental zero-gravity cocktails purely for the data

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees lunar base as perfect proving ground for Anduril’s autonomous perimeter security pods and low-latency comms
- Keen to debate closed-loop VR training for off-world crews; looking for chefs/scientists to design palate-shift menus for space tourism
- Wants to meet visionary municipal leaders planning moon-to-Earth telepresence districts
- Offers: demo of portable multi-sensor sentry unit (fits in a checked suitcase) for live moon test, plus Oculus heritage stories for media buzz

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Prime intros: NASA Artemis logistics team, Axiom Space habitat designers, SoftBank’s Vision Fund 3 space desk
- Could benefit from chefs experimenting with neurogastronomy to refine VR-synchronized dining
- Engage him by asking: “What cold-war gadget inspired your latest prototype?”; segue into your own “unusual or surprising” fact to fulfill the conversation prompt
- Ideal setting: hands-on demo corner with tinkering tools—he gravitates to wires over wine

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Press still circling past political donations—avoid unless he raises it
- Prefers direct challenges to polite nods; pose a “why won’t this work on the moon?” question
- Follow-up items: confirm interest in post-event private range day to test drone control latency under lunar-sim gravity; request advance on memoir anecdote clearance
