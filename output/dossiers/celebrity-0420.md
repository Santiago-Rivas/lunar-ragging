### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Ben Goertzel

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Cascais, Portugal (walkable to SingularityNET’s Lisbon engineering hub)
- Secondary orbit: Hong Kong → Dubai → Austin circuit for fundraising and political advocacy
- “Digital nomad since before the term existed”; will happily spend months in micro-gravity if there’s good Wi-Fi

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- CEO & Chief Scientist, SingularityNET – decentralized AI marketplace built on Cardano
- Founder, OpenCog Hyperon – open-source cognitive architecture targeting artificial general intelligence (AGI) by 2029
- Scientific Chairman, Rejuve.ai (blockchain-driven longevity research); creator of the humanoid robots Sophia & Grace with Hanson Robotics

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a $75 M token-denominated Ecosystem Fund to accelerate Hyperon modules (probabilistic reasoning, neural-symbolic integration)
- Piloting Grace robot in elder-care clinics across Japan and the UAE
- Negotiating a lunar edge-compute demonstrator: tiny, radiation-hardened AGI node co-hosted on upcoming private lander (2026)
- Personal goal: complete first full-length jazz-prog concept album “Mathematics of Love” before his 60th birthday
- Exploring cross-licensing with psychedelics R&D labs to study AI-guided psychometric feedback loops

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Plays avant-garde piano; wrote an off-Broadway cyber-opera in his 20s—few know he can freestyle rap in Mandarin
- Guiding maxim: “Intelligence is the universe waking up to itself.”
- Practices Chen-style tai-chi on conference balconies at dawn; claims it “debugs the mind’s source code”
- Enjoys late-night philosophical debates on panpsychism, often fueled by Ethiopian coffee and vegan mooncakes

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as proof-of-concept for off-world AGI/robotic collaboration hubs
- Hopes to secure partners for power, thermal, and comms requirements of the 2026 AGI node
- Prepared to discuss ethical governance models for autonomous systems operating beyond national jurisdiction
- Offers visionary storytelling: how decentralized AI, biotech, and space industry intertwine to extend human presence and lifespan

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: Intuitive Machines lunar data services team, ESA’s Moonlight comms consortium, any VC fund with dual interest in deep tech + space
- Could advise attendees on tokenized incentive structures for distributed research collectives
- Best engaged via open-ended questions (“How would an AGI perceive lunar isolation?”) rather than elevator-pitch bombardment
- Thrives when paired with musicians or poets—organize an impromptu zero-G jam session to bond

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Attention flits rapidly; prep one crisp ask and one imaginative thought experiment
- Sensitive topic: he’s weary of “AI doom” narratives—frame safety questions around cooperative design, not fear
- Follow-up probes: status of Grace robot clinical data; timeline for Hyperon-to-Cardano bridge completion
