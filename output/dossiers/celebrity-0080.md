### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Bill Withers

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles  
- Maintains a retreat studio in Beckley, West Virginia (near his hometown)  
- Rarely tours; travels only for thoughtfully curated experiences or philanthropic missions—makes the 238,900-mile jump to the Moon a notable exception  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Legendary singer-songwriter & producer; catalog includes “Lean on Me,” “Ain’t No Sunshine,” “Lovely Day”  
- Founder, Golden Valley Publishing—retains master rights and licenses for film, gaming, and immersive media  
- 3× Grammy winner; 2023 inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame’s “Legends” category for lifetime social-impact songwriting  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Curating 55th-anniversary spatial-audio box set, partnering with Dolby Atmos Labs  
- Developing “Songs for the Stratosphere,” a cross-platform project using microgravity recordings to study human emotional response in space  
- Expanding the Just As I Am Foundation—funds STEAM programs in underserved Appalachian schools and supports speech-therapy access (a nod to his own childhood stutter)  
- Quietly scouting next-gen rights-management tech to future-proof his catalog against AI-generated voice cloning  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate woodworker; personally crafts guitars from reclaimed Appalachian walnut (“working with my hands clears the fog”)  
- Amateur aviation historian; logged 800+ private-pilot hours before grounding himself in 2018  
- Guiding maxim: “Simplicity hits the heart harder than spectacle—until the spectacle carries the same heart.”  
- Loves chess blitz matches; insists on analog boards to feel the weight of each decision  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Dinner Party as a testbed for “Songs for the Stratosphere” and to gauge lunar acoustics for live-stem recording  
- Eager to trade insights on how altered gravity and isolation shape creativity, mental health, and community bonding  
- Brings universal-unity storytelling—a live rendition of “Lean on Me (Lunar Mix)” could become the emotional centerpiece and PR moment for Planta  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Seeks introductions to:  
  • Space-habitat acoustic engineers (ESA, JAXA)  
  • IP lawyers versed in off-Earth jurisdiction for performance rights  
  • CSR leads at tech giants willing to co-fund STEAM initiatives tied to lunar broadcasts  
- Offers: mentorship on narrative-driven branding, original score snippets for Planta’s post-event content, and credibility with mainstream press  
- Engagement tips: approach with curiosity about craftsmanship or flight; invite him to tinker with 3D-printed instrument prototypes onboard  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers low-key authenticity; disdains over-polished “VIP wrangling”  
- Unusual fact he may reveal if prompted: once built a secret recording booth inside a C-130 cargo plane fuselage to capture engines’ harmonic hum for a never-released track  
- Follow-up area: confirm legal path for broadcasting moon-recorded music back to Earth without terrestrial-only license constraints
