- Building a post-playing portfolio around sustainable agriculture tech (hydroponic greens grown in repurposed shipping containers)  
- Personal: third child born March 2025; intent on capping travel days at 120/yr, heightening interest in virtual collaboration tools  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Chess addict (ELO ~1800); equates midfield play to “controlling the center file”  
- Reads stoic philosophy—favorite mantra: “We suffer more in imagination than in reality.”  
- Amateur barista; travels with compact espresso setup—vacuum-sealed beans, lunar gravity experiment likely to amuse him  
- Enjoys talking about nutrient timing and gut microbiome; experimenting with fermented foods, matches Planta’s cuisine innovation theme  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Public draw: first elite athlete to dine on the Moon; brings massive social media reach (17 M combined followers) to amplify event narrative  
- Curious about micro-gravity’s effect on proprioception—wants to demo a mini “keep-ups” challenge for educational content

- Brings disciplined, team-oriented mindset; can articulate parallels between space crew cohesion and elite sport dynamics  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired:  
  • ESA life-support engineers working on closed-loop agriculture

  • Michelin-level nutritionists experimenting with low-gravity food textures  
- Offer attendees: leadership frameworks from high-pressure matches; brand visibility via collaborative posts

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
