### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Riz Ahmed

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: North London (family & writing studio) and Los Angeles (Left Handed Films headquarters)
- Regular circuits: Berlin, Toronto, Doha for film festivals; Nairobi & Karachi for social-impact storytelling labs

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Left Handed Films – multi-platform studio focused on under-represented voices across film, TV, XR, and music
- Academy Award–nominated actor (Sound of Metal) and Emmy winner (The Night Of); respected rapper under the moniker Riz MC
- UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador; Forbes “30 Under 30” alumnus turned mentor-at-large for diverse creators

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Developing “NomadVerse,” a serialized immersive narrative about climate migration set on Mars; partners include Epic Games and MIT Media Lab
- Executive-producing a BBC/Netflix limited series adapting Mohsin Hamid’s “Exit West,” shooting Q4 2025
- Finalizing second studio album blending qawwali influences with modular synth—planned 2026 drop alongside holographic live shows
- Training in freediving and micro-gravity movement for an untitled art-film essay to be shot aboard the Axiom orbital station

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend passion: calligraphy of Urdu poetry—finds it “a meditation against digital noise”
- Practices lucid-dream journaling; views it as a scripting tool for non-linear storytelling
- Guiding philosophy: “Story is a borderless spacecraft—take people somewhere new, then land them back changed.”
- Secret quirk: collects vintage space-race postage stamps; fascinated by how nations narrativized the cosmos

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the lunar dinner as a living metaphor for diaspora and belonging—wants to capture real-time audio for a spoken-word piece titled “Gravity of Home”
- Seeking collaborators in sensory tech to embed scent and haptics into XR narratives (he envisions viewers “smelling moonscape dust”)
- Offers magnetic stage presence for an impromptu low-gravity rap / poetry session, leveraging event buzz for mutual PR lift

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to: 
  • Planta engineers working on neural-linked wearables  
  • ESA or JAXA scientists open to consulting on “NomadVerse” accuracy  
  • Culinary chemists experimenting with flavor under reduced gravity (album tie-in visuals)
- Attendees can help by sharing personal migration stories for his oral-history archive
- Engagement tip: Ask about the parallel between diaspora identity and spacefaring settlers—ignites his best anecdotes

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers candid, small-group dialogue over stagey photo-ops; allocate a quiet viewport table for deep talk
- Refrain from referring to him solely as a “Muslim actor”—he’s wary of reductive labels
- Follow-up question aligned with host prompt: “What’s an unexpected skill rehearsed for micro-gravity that never made it on screen?”
