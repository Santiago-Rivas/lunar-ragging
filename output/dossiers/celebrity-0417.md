### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Audrey Tang

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Taipei City, Taiwan  
- Regular circuits: Berlin (re: open-source community), San Francisco Bay Area (civic-tech investors), Geneva (digital-rights forums)  
- Known for scheduling “midnight UTC” calls—keeps an intentionally fluid sleep cycle to sync with global collaborators  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Minister of Digital Affairs, Executive Yuan, Taiwan; oversees cybersecurity, broadband resilience, and participatory platforms  
- Architect of vTaiwan & Join.gov.tw—the gold-standard for large-scale crowd-law experiments  
- First openly transgender cabinet member in Asia; Time “100 Most Influential” & World Economic Forum “Top Public Servant in Tech”  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Launching Taiwan’s Post-Quantum Encryption Framework ahead of 2026 presidential election cycle  
- Building the “Pluriverse Protocol,” an interoperability stack that stitches together civic data commons across jurisdictions  
- Personal R&D: generative music coded in Rust for mental-health interventions; seeking artistic partners to score “democracy sonifications”  
- Preparing a memoir-manifesto on “radical transparency after AI ubiquity,” slated for Q4 2026 release  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong Go player; uses the game as a metaphor for non-zero-sum governance  
- Devout Sondheim enthusiast—can quote entire “Sunday in the Park with George”; enjoys impromptu a-capella if prompted  
- Guiding maxim: “Rough consensus and running code beats polished consensus and dormant code.”  
- Collects 18th-century French cipher wheels; sees them as reminders that privacy tech precedes politics  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Moon dinner aligns with Tang’s thesis that “location becomes a variable in the civic equation”—testing community rituals off-planet  
- Exploring tele-presence holography to let Earth citizens co-experience lunar gatherings; eager to discuss Planta’s latency-mitigation tech  
- Seeks dialogue on governance models for mixed-jurisdiction habitats (lunar base = neutral territory)  
- Can contribute frameworks for transparent decision logging and consensus tools adaptable to low-bandwidth environments  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros: ESA and JAXA human-factors leads, Starlink laser-backhaul engineers, and any chefs experimenting with neuro-gastronomy (for multisensory policy demos)  
- Attendees could assist by sharing edge-case connectivity data from analog Mars habitats or Antarctic stations  
- Engagement tips: open with a tactical puzzle or ask how they forked a recent civic-tech repo; Tang enjoys instantaneous co-creation—have a shared document or code editor ready  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Preferred pronouns: they/she; address as “Audrey” (titles discouraged)  
- Politically sensitive: avoid framing discussions as “Taiwan vs. China”—frame instead around “open society resilience”  
- Potentially surprising question to surface during the dinner: “Which piece of code have you left intentionally imperfect, and why?”  
- Follow-up area: invite Tang to beta test a synchronous Earth-Moon co-authoring tool for their forthcoming memoir
