### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** James Tour

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Houston, TX (Rice University campus & nearby pilot-plant for flash graphene)
- Frequent travel loop: Tel Aviv ↔ Washington DC ↔ Seoul for joint materials labs, DARPA briefings, and battery-grade graphene negotiations

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- T.T. & W.F. Chao Prof. of Chemistry, Rice University; directs Tour Lab (≈45 researchers across chemistry, nano-engineering, and bio-interfaces)
- Founder/board: Universal Matter (flash-graphene production); NanoRex (carbon-nanotube rebar); CGI Therapeutics (molecular machines for targeted oncology)
- Over 750 peer-reviewed papers, 200+ patents; “Scientist of the Year” ‑ R&D Magazine, 2023

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling flash-graphene reactors from 1-kg to 100-kg/day to meet aerospace composites demand
- Closing $60 M Series B for silicon–graphene anodes enabling >500 Wh/kg lunar-grade batteries
- Pushing pre-clinical data on light-activated nano-drills that perforate antibiotic-resistant bacteria
- Personal: crafting a lay-audience book on “unexpected miracles in materials science”; studio time reserved weekly for blues-rock guitar recording

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend street-motorcycle racer; says the rush “keeps my reaction kinetics sharp”
- Devout Christian apologist—enjoys interfaith philosophy debates yet avoids public political entanglements
- Runs private maker-garage; restores 1960s Guild guitars and embeds custom graphene pickups
- Guiding maxim: “If you can’t draw the molecule on a diner napkin, you don’t understand it.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Luna dinner aligns with his advocacy for in-situ resource utilization: keen to discuss converting lunar regolith + carbon feedstocks into graphene-reinforced habitat panels
- Seeks collaborators on low-gravity sintering experiments aboard Gateway station; interested chefs who will test graphene-based heating surfaces in micro-g kitchens
- Offers captivating micro-demo: handheld flash-graphene spark unit (safe indoors) that converts table scraps to graphene flakes in seconds—ideal conversation spark

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA’s in-situ materials team (Dr. Violet Zhang), SpaceX Starship payload procurement, and Mubadala Ventures’ advanced materials fund
- Helpful resources: lunar dust simulant access, micro-gravity furnace time slots, co-marketing with luxury watchmakers using Tour-Lab carbon nano-shells
- Engagement tips: open with music gear or superbikes; pivot to “How would you build a bridge on the Moon?”—he’ll dive in enthusiastically

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid long evolutionary origin debates; he finds them draining in social settings
- Unusual fact to tease out (per conversation goal): at 17 he funded his first lab by repairing pinball machines in New York arcades—few outside his family know
- Follow-up: confirm if Universal Matter has secured the 99.999% helium-free inert gas supply critical for lunar reactor prototype testing
