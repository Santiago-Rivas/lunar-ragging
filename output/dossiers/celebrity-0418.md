### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Autumn Peltier

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Wiikwemkoong Unceded Territory, Manitoulin Island, Ontario  
- Secondary hubs: Ottawa for policy work; New York City for UN engagements  
- Frequent travel to Arctic communities, Europe, and Asia for water-rights summits and tech pilot visits

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chief Water Commissioner, Anishinabek Nation (appointed 2019; represents 39 First Nations)  
- Founder, Nibi (“Water” in Anishinaabemowin) Futures Lab – incubating climate-resilient water filtration and reclamation tech  
- Key achievements: Addressed UN General Assembly (age 13); TIME “100 Most Influential People in Climate”; brokered $120 M federal commitment to upgrade Indigenous water infrastructure (2024)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Guiding the rapid deployment of modular, solar-powered nano-filtration units across 20 northern communities by Q4 2025  
- Securing Series A financing ($15 M) for Nibi Futures Lab to scale closed-loop water systems adaptable to lunar and Martian habitats  
- Co-producing a docuseries with National Geographic on Indigenous ecological knowledge and off-world sustainability (premieres 2026)  
- Personal: Training for a 30 km open-water swim in Lake Superior to raise funds for water-stewardship scholarships

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Avid astrophotographer; travels with a compact deep-sky rig and posts moon-phase composites on a private Instagram “for friends only”  
- Practices traditional Midewiwin water songs each dawn—believes “ceremony is data the heart can read”  
- Favorite adage: “Water remembers; so will future generations.”  
- Fascinated by biomimicry—recently studying how tardigrades manage desiccation for inspiration in space-grade hydration packs

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending to evaluate Planta’s closed-loop hydroponics and grey-water recycling system for cultural, ethical, and technical robustness  
- Looking to embed Indigenous relational-ethics framework within off-world community guidelines; seeks allies who can advance this in corporate and policy spheres  
- Prepared to lead a short “Water Honour Ceremony” under the lunar dome—rare chance to blend ancestral protocol with extraterrestrial context  
- Could offer critical insight on micro-contaminant detection (PFOAs, PFOS) in confined environments

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • Blue Origin’s environmental engineering team (lunar resource utilization)  
  • Patagonia’s Tin Shed Ventures (impact investing)  
  • Artemis Accords working group on In-Situ Resource Utilization  
- Attendees can assist by sharing sensor data from experimental lunar water loops and by co-funding pilot tests in extreme terrestrial analog sites  
- Best engagement tactics: invite her into technical walkthroughs, then pivot to cultural implications; she thrives on bridging hard science with values storytelling

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Declines alcohol; prefers herbal tea or plain, ceremonially blessed water  
- Responds poorly to green-washing language—bring concrete metrics  
- Surprising fact to surface if conversation stalls: she composes synth-ambient tracks sampled from lake and river field recordings; releases them under the alias “Aurora Nibi” on Bandcamp  
- Follow-up intel to gather: progress of Canadian Senate bill on Indigenous water guardians program and list of international partners interested in off-planet applications
