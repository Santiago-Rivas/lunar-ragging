### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Anne Aaron

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Gatos, California (Netflix HQ)  
- Maintains an apartment in Manila; spends two weeks each quarter in Southeast Asia mentoring local deep-tech founders  
- Frequent stops in London and Stockholm for EU streaming-standards working groups  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Senior Director, Video Algorithms & Streaming, Netflix (leads 110-person cross-continental org)  
- Architect behind Netflix’s per-title & per-shot encoding pipeline—now industry benchmark for adaptive bitrate efficiency  
- IEEE Fellow 2024; holds 54 patents across video compression, perceptual quality metrics, and edge delivery  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Driving implementation of ML-based neural compression targeting 35 % bandwidth reduction over AV1 by 2026  
- Piloting real-time volumetric video streams for immersive “holo-watch parties” inside Apple Vision Pro / Meta Quest ecosystems  
- Personal mission: incubate a home-grown Filipino research hub for media AI; funding secured, site scouting Q3 2025  
- Training for a sub-orbital flight with Virgin Galactic—part science nerd, part credibility play for “space-native streaming” roadmap  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate freediver; claims time under water helps her “think in wavelets”  
- Collects vintage Filipino jazz records; uses them as audio test beds for codec tonal accuracy  
- Guiding philosophy: “Fidelity should serve emotion, not the other way around.”  
- Quietly sketches sci-fi comics—rarely shared, but excellent icebreaker if asked about non-codec art  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Planta invited her to ensure flawless high-definition live relay of the lunar dinner back to Earth and VR headsets  
- Eager to explore low-latency edge compute strategies on lunar surface and cislunar satellites  
- Wants candid insights from astronauts on the psychoacoustics of confined habitats to refine spatial audio models  
- Offers deep technical chops, a vast vendor network, and Netflix’s megaphone to amplify the event’s cultural impact  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • Intuitive Machines or ispace teams handling lunar data relays  
  • Nvidia’s “Grace Blackwell” edge GPU group for on-site transcoding  
  • Culinary neuro-gastronomists studying flavor perception in micro-gravity  
- Attendees can help by sharing empirical data on lunar radiation’s effect on solid-state drives—critical for her redundancy planning  
- Best engagement approach: pose a thorny compression problem; she lights up when whiteboarding trade-offs and error budgets  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers direct, technically rigorous dialogue; marketing fluff is an instant turn-off  
- Cultural grace point: acknowledge her Philippine heritage—she actively champions diversity in STEM  
- Follow-up questions worth asking:  
  • Status of the Manila media-AI lab and potential joint fellowships  
  • Lessons from her sub-orbital training that could inform Planta’s lunar guest-prep protocols
