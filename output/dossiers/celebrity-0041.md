### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Stevie Wonder

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Bel-Air, Los Angeles; maintains a studio compound in Hollywood
- Regular travel pattern: Detroit family visits quarterly; annual humanitarian trips to Ghana & Ethiopia; still comfortable with overnight tour flights despite reduced touring schedule

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Wonder Communications Group (publishing, studio services, adaptive-tech investments)
- Iconic singer-songwriter; 25 Grammy Awards, Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Oscar for “I Just Called to Say I Love You”
- Long-time UN Messenger of Peace; pivotal lobbyist behind the 2010 UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ratification push in the U.S.

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing “Through the Cosmos”—a concept album recorded with spatial-audio arrays to create a 360° experience for blind and sighted listeners alike (target release: late 2026)
- Backing a Series A in Orbital Audio, a startup adapting bone-conduction headsets for low-gravity environments
- Designing the Wonder Vision Foundation’s 50th-anniversary campaign focused on universal design for off-world habitats
- Personally experimenting with hydroponic herb gardens; intends to launch a music-and-botany curriculum for visually impaired youth

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong fascination with astronomy—memorizes star coordinates the way others recall landmarks
- Enjoys spontaneous jam sessions—always travels with a chromatic harmonica; in zero-g he’s curious how breath control alters tone
- Guiding philosophy: “If you limit your vision to what eyes see, you miss half the colors of life.”
- Surprising quirk: collects vintage talking wristwatches; keeps them calibrated to multiple time zones “to hear the planet’s rhythm”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as both sensory experiment and statement on inclusive exploration beyond Earth
- Wants to discuss tactile way-finding and non-visual social cues in lunar architecture; open to advising Planta on multisensory event layers (scent, vibration, sound mapping)
- Offers star-story performance segment using live lunar sky as backdrop—could be a highlight moment
- Seeking collaborators for the “Cosmic Choir”—a crowd-sourced track he’ll assemble from field recordings captured on the Moon

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX life-support design team (for accessibility inputs); chefs working with NASA Food Tech; investors in neuro-haptic interfaces
- Attendees can assist by providing raw audio of lunar equipment ambience for his album interludes
- Best engagement: invite him to touch and “hear” the tableware’s material resonance; present conversation topics as open-ended prompts rather than visual slides

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Ensure Braille or tactile menus; keep pathway from docking bay to dining hall obstacle-free
- Prefers genuine curiosity over fan praise; avoid leading with chart statistics
- Follow-up Qs: desired latency specs for orbital audio gear; interest in co-creating a post-event accessibility whitepaper with Planta’s design team
