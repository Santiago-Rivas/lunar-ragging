### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Bret Victor

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Oakland, California (Dynamicland headquarters)
- Regular 2–3 week stints in Reykjavík and Kyoto to study low-light public spaces and artisanal papermaking
- Avoids typical conference circuits; travels only when the venue itself is an “experimental medium” worth studying

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Research Director, Dynamicland – a nonprofit laboratory turning physical rooms into programmable, collaborative thinking spaces
- Former Human Interface Inventor, Apple Special Projects Group; credited on several unreleased AR interface patents
- Thought leader behind “Explorable Explanations” and the landmark talk “Inventing on Principle,” influencing a generation of tools-for-thought developers

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Prototyping “Room-Scale Simulation Sheets”: large-format, fabric-based displays woven with conductive fibers for tactile computation
- Assembling a $40 M philanthropic coalition to replicate Dynamicland nodes in public libraries across five continents by 2028
- Personal 12-month learning sprint on closed-loop environmental systems—aiming to design computation that is literally powered by the phenomena it models (e.g., algae-powered logic gates)
- Quietly writing a book-length manifesto, “The Humane Colony,” arguing for screenless interfaces in off-planet habitats

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Restores antique mechanical calculators; says “every gear teaches humility”
- Plays hammered dulcimer; believes music offers the purest interface metaphor (continuous feedback, embodied nuance)
- Guiding philosophy: “Ideas live in the space between people, not inside devices”
- Surprising tidbit: competed in amateur figure skating until age 19—maintains ritual dawn skates for flow-state research

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a live testbed for communal computing without Earth’s sensory defaults—keen to explore how reduced gravity reshapes gestural input and shared attention
- Wants introductions to life-support engineers to stress-test his closed-loop computation concept
- Brings the ability to visualize complex conversations on the spot using paper-and-light prototypes—could map attendee dialogues into interactive tabletop models during the meal

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA’s Habitability Design Group, ESA’s Advanced Concepts Team, Patagonia’s philanthropic arm (for library roll-out)
- Attendees can help by sharing novel sustainable power sources, or venues willing to host pop-up Dynamicland “thinking rooms”
- Engagement tips: skip elevator pitches; ask him to “show rather than tell.” Offering a blank notebook or unusual physical artifact reliably sparks deep discussion

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Highly sensitive to fluorescent lighting and background music—ensure table lighting is warm, indirect
- Dislikes discussions framed around “efficiency”; prefers language of discovery and human understanding
- Follow-up questions worth asking: status of the Reykjavík public-library prototype, and whether he’ll open-source the conductive-fabric loom design
