### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Chris Evans

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Boston → Los Angeles split (Boston for family anchoring, LA for studio access)  
- Regular East Coast shuttle; annual humanitarian trips to South America with team from Christopher’s Haven

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & Principal, A Starting Point – nonpartisan civic-engagement media platform reaching 12 M monthly uniques  
- Actor-producer, ACE Media; first-look deal with Amazon MGM Studios (focus on grounded sci-fi & historical thrillers)  
- Iconic portrayal of Captain America; Forbes “100 Most Powerful Celebrities” 5×; cumulative global box office $9 B+

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Packaging “Helios,” a limited series dramatizing humanity’s first deep-space colony (wants real aerospace consultants)  
- Negotiating minority stake in Orbital-View, an XR startup offering live-rendered lunar environments for education  
- Personal: mastering conversational Mandarin ahead of 2026 Shanghai-based film shoot; maintaining mental-health advocacy momentum after recent PTSD-awareness campaign  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Closet tap-dancer; trains weekly with choreographer Chloe Arnold—loves swapping playlists of 1930s jazz cuts  
- Philosophy buff—keeps a battered copy of Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations in his carry-on (“objective judgment, now, at this very moment”)  
- Epicurean curiosity: runs an Instagram burner account rating roadside diners; fascinated by food as cultural storytelling  
- Enjoys tinkering with epoxy-resin woodworking; builds dog-bowls for rescue shelters with his brother Scott  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence underscores pop-culture reach of lunar civility narrative; ideal narrator/producer for post-event documentary  
- Seeking cutting-edge set-capture tech & zero-G filming techniques for “Helios” and future ACE Media slate  
- Curious how Planta’s social-connectivity hardware can translate civic-engagement content in low-bandwidth off-world settings  
- Brings charisma, audience trust, and 48 M social followers—can amplify event themes to mainstream without “corporate” tone  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intro desired to:  
  • Gwynne Shotwell (SpaceX) for consult on realistic spacecraft interiors  
  • Chef Heston Blumenthal (attending) to brainstorm sensory-shift dining for on-screen narratives  
  • XR engineer team at Planta for possible Orbital-View partnership  
- Attendees can help by sharing personal “first frontier” stories—usable as micro-interviews on A Starting Point  
- Engage him with off-beat angles: ask about best diner grilled-cheese in Vermont or his handmade Dodger-logo cutting board  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Keeps public persona light but values depth; respond with sincerity over star-struck flattery  
- Mild social anxiety in unfamiliar tech crowds—private preview of venue layout reassures him  
- Quietly looking for philanthropic extensions: lunar-based STEM learning modules for Boston public schools  
- Follow-up question for host: “What’s the craziest behind-the-scenes mishap that led to this dinner on the Moon?”—gives him story fodder and fulfills conversation goal of uncovering the surprising.
