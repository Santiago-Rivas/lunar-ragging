### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Brian Tyree Henry

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Brooklyn Heights, NYC  
- Secondary foothold: Midtown Atlanta condo (close to family and “Atlanta” production team)  
- Frequent travel loop: LA ⇄ London ⇄ New York for film shoots and West End theatre workshops  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Actor & emerging producer; recent Oscar-nominee (Best Supporting Actor, “Causeway,” 2023)  
- Breakout role: Alfred “Paper Boi” Miles in FX’s “Atlanta” (Peabody & Emmy wins)  
- Franchise presence: Marvel’s “Eternals” (Phastos) and voice of Jefferson Davis in “Spider-Verse” series  
- Executive-producing slate under newly formed banner, Quiet Thunder, focused on “genre stories told through under-heard voices”  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Pre-production on a limited series set aboard an interplanetary cargo vessel—researching confinement psychology and zero-G movement coaching  
- Building Quiet Thunder’s first financing round ($25 M target) to retain creative ownership; courting tech-forward co-investors who value inclusive narratives  
- Personal goal: earn a pilot’s license by end of 2026; sees flight training as a mental reset between shoots  
- Philanthropic push: expanding partnership with Atlanta’s Urban Youth Music Conservatory—introducing a VR sound-design lab for teens  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong comic-book collector; keeps a graded copy of “Fantastic Four #48” on set for luck  
- Self-taught gourmet—obsessed with fermentation; experiments with koji-aged collard greens (“Southern umami”)  
- Guiding thought: “The story you tell yourself at 3 a.m. directs the story everyone else sees at 3 p.m.”  
- Surprising fact he rarely shares: was a cryptologic linguist trainee in the Army before shifting to Juilliard—still decodes ciphers as a calming hobby  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Moon Dinner for sensory-environment R&D ideas that Quiet Thunder can translate into cinematic XR experiences  
- Wants candid conversations about how microgravity shapes communal rituals—material for upcoming space-drama character work  
- Offers magnetic on-camera presence; could amplify Planta’s vision through future documentary or scripted crossover content  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Ideal intros:  
  • Planta’s spatial-audio engineers (tie-in with youth VR lab)  
  • NASA’s Artemis culture outreach team (potential series consultant)  
  • Culinary technologist who developed the event’s lunar fermentation module  
- Helpful asks: access to event’s biometric sensor data for actor movement research; warm lead to impact-oriented media funds aligned with DEI storytelling  
- Engage him with: blind “flavor-in-a-vacuum” tasting challenge, or a quick cipher puzzle carved into the table UI—activates his playful competitiveness  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers intimate circles over large-stage remarks; schedule a brief one-on-one during habitat night cycle  
- Sensitive area: avoids deep dives into Atlanta show’s end—focus on future projects instead  
- Follow-up questions: status of pilot’s license progress and whether he’s secured a technical advisor for zero-G acting technique
