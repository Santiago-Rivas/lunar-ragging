**FULL NAME:** Luis Fonsi

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Miami, FL
- Maintains studios in San Juan (family ties) and Madrid (European collaborations)
- Regularly on the road: Latin-America stadium circuit and emerging markets in Asia; plans bi-monthly shuttles between Miami–Mexico City through 2026 tour cycle

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Global recording artist, songwriter, and producer; 7× Latin Grammy winner
- Founder, LF Entertainment Group: publishing, live-event production, and a new VR concert subsidiary
- Brand ambassador roles with UNICEF, Puerto Rico Relief Fund, and high-visibility tech brands (Samsung Latinx music innovation campaign)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Wrapping a bilingual pop-fusion album slated for Q3 2026; experimenting with AI-generated backing vocals and spatial audio masters
- Building “Gravity Sessions,” a zero-G performance concept for commercial space flights (still in R&D with Axiom Space engineers)
- Equity partner in SoundSphere, a start-up developing haptic concert wearables for deaf and hard-of-hearing fans
- Personal: refining astronaut-level fitness regimen; quietly training in parabolic flights to understand microgravity breathing techniques for singers

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Gourmet hobby chef—obsessed with perfecting Puerto Rican mofongo using molecular gastronomy tricks
- Collects vintage Leica rangefinder cameras; loves impromptu photo walks in every tour city
- Guiding belief: “A melody should travel faster than light—if physics won’t allow it, technology will”
- Keeps a handwritten lyric journal (prefers fountain pens); rarely shows it—offering a peek can signal genuine rapport

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Draws massive, diverse audience reach—ideal cultural amplifier for Planta’s lunar vision
- Curious about acoustic physics in low gravity; wants to test short vocal improvisations inside the lunar habitat
- Seeking partners who can integrate live music into immersive, multi-sensory experiences (AR, aroma, texture) for a 2027–28 global tour
- Could contribute an exclusive micro-performance or theme melody for post-dinner media assets

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to: Blue Origin’s Orbital Reef entertainment unit, Dolby Atmos R&D, chef José Andrés (space-appropriate cuisine collaboration)
- Attendees can help by sharing data on human perception shifts in extraterrestrial environments—useful for composing “lunar-tuned” music
- Engage him with a quick cooking anecdote or ask about the Leica M6 he usually carries; segue into how he frames moments beyond Earth

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Unusual fact prompt: He was a college choir exchange student in London and once busked at Covent Garden under a pseudonym—a story he seldom tells
- Sensitive: keeps political activism quiet after Hurricane Maria fund-raising backlash; avoid partisan angles
- Follow-up Qs: timeline for “Gravity Sessions” prototype tests; interest level in becoming a Planta music ambassador post-event
