### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Franz von Holzhausen

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Manhattan Beach, CA (Tesla Design Center in nearby Hawthorne)  
- Weekly shuttles to Austin HQ; bi-monthly on-site reviews at Gigafactories in Berlin & Shanghai  
- Quiet weekend retreat in Taos, NM for high-altitude sketching and prototype clay work  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chief Designer, Tesla Inc. — leads aesthetics and human-factor integration for all vehicle, energy, and robotics lines  
- Design consultant, SpaceX Interiors — shaping crewed-Starship cabin ergonomics and materials strategy  
- Signature achievements: Model S design language that re-defined EV desirability; Cybertruck exoskeleton; steering yoke UI paradigm now emulated by five OEMs  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing next-gen $25 K Tesla compact and its autonomous “no-pedal” cockpit  
- Integrating plant-based, lunar-grade composites sourced from von Holzhausen’s own materials startup with wife Vicki  
- Roadster 2.0 interior testing for 2-g acceleration comfort; wants first production run ready for 2027 Earth-Moon celebrity “lap”  
- Personally shepherding Tesla Optimus robot exterior to look approachable in domestic settings—avoiding “metal butler” clichés  
- Exploring zero-VOC fabrication techniques after California regulatory tightening slated for 2026  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Avid gravel-bike racer; claims best ideas hit at mile 40 when glycogen is low  
- Collects mid-century Japanese woodblock prints for line-weight inspiration  
- Keeps a “design cleanse” rule: one full day per month sketching purely organic forms—no screens, only charcoal  
- Favorite maxim: “Emotion first, engineering second—great design makes specs feel inevitable.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Only global designer currently shaping both Earth and lunar mobility platforms—ideal voice on aesthetics of off-planet living  
- Seeking insights on human social cues in 1/6 g environments to inform Starship lounge layout  
- Curious about Planta’s sensorial tech to embed multi-spectrum lighting in vehicle cabins for circadian regulation during deep-space trips  
- Will gladly share lessons on rapid iteration between CAD and full-scale physical prototypes in constrained environments  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable introductions: bio-fabricated textile researchers, Michelin-level chefs exploring low-gravity plating, NASA psychological habitation specialists  
- Attendees can assist by offering user-testing data on motion sickness mitigation or cross-modal dining experiences  
- Engage him by asking for a “quick napkin sketch” of your wildest lunar concept—he loves impromptu co-creation sessions  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Surprising fact he seldom reveals: studied percussion at Berklee for a semester; designs car door “thunks” with drum-maker precision—perfect icebreaker for the host’s question  
- Prefers small, focused conversations over stage spotlights; arrange a post-dessert stroll near the observation dome  
- Follow-up area: gauge appetite for joint research grant pairing Tesla Materials Lab with Planta’s bio-lighting division for 2028 Mars transit habitats
