- Personal goal: complete a live-streamed “Moon Pump” workout during the mission window for his 80th birthday campaign

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Daily dawn rides with his miniature donkeys Lulu & Whiskey; uses them as unexpected icebreakers in policy meetings

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to symbolize the human drive to push physical and social boundaries in off-world settings
- Eager to discuss: lunar-based food sustainability, optimizing muscle retention in micro-gravity, and storytelling that normalizes climate-positive space ventures
- Looking for collaborators: biomechanical engineers, Michelin-level plant-based chefs, VR studios that can stream the “Moon Pump” globally
- Offers marquee media draw, cross-sector credibility, and decades of experience turning bold ideas into mainstream movements

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES

- Politically independent—frame climate topics as “public health” and “economic opportunity,” not partisan debate
- Follow-up questions: status of the Moon Pump livestream permits; whether he will auction signed lunar workout gear for his after-school foundation
