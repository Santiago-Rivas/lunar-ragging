### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Leah Culver

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: San Francisco, CA (Noe Valley); keeps a small crash pad in Austin for SXSW-adjacent projects  
- FAA-licensed private pilot—flies her own Cirrus SR20 to Los Angeles & Seattle on alternating weekends to stay close to audio-creator communities

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & former CEO, Breaker (social-podcast platform acquired by Twitter 2021); now independent builder  
- Founding engineer, Pownce; early API architect at Dropbox (led OAuth integration)  
- Current focus: stealth venture “EchoSphere” building decentralized, spatial-audio social layers for AR/VR and off-planet environments

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing $12 M seed round (led by Eclipse Ventures) to fund EchoSphere’s lunar/low-gravity audio research lab  
- Prototyping adaptive codecs that self-tune to extreme latency—ideal for cislunar communication  
- Personally training with Zero-G flights, aiming for a commercial astronaut qualification by 2028  
- Writing a short book, “Sound Beyond Atmosphere,” expected Q1 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend hobby: restoring a 1968 Beechcraft Musketeer in a shared Oakland hangar  
- Obsessed with mid-century sci-fi pulp art; maintains a 400-issue private collection  
- Guiding philosophy: “Build the tool you wish existed, then give away the manual.”  
- Swears by 30-minute “audio walks” each morning—records ambient noise to fuel product inspiration

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Planta’s lunar dinner is a live use-case for EchoSphere’s latency-adaptive audio; Leah wants to capture and stream the event’s 1/6-g acoustics in real time  
- Seeks: partners with on-base networking gear, acoustic engineers, and rights holders for a moon-recording NFT drop  
- Offers: can set up a pop-up audio lab, host a mini “storytelling in zero gravity” workshop, and advise Planta on social-layer engagement

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX Starlink laser-relay team; NASA Ames Human-Factors group; Sony Immersive Audio R&D  
- Attendees could help by sharing sensory data (vibration, pressure) for her codec-training set  
- Best engagement: invite her to co-pilot the discussion on “How does community sound off Earth?”—give her a headset, a mic, and permission to experiment live

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: sold the famed “Pink Painted Lady” after renovation costs ballooned—topic is touchy; steer conversation toward aviation or audio instead  
- Unusual fact prompt: collects rare Soviet vacuum tubes and uses them to build one-off moon-rock-shaped amps  
- Prefers small, purpose-driven side chats over group panels; follow-up Q: Would she commit to recording Planta’s first interplanetary podcast episode?
