### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Harry Kane

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Munich, Germany (club season)  
- Secondary base: North London, UK (family residence & charity HQ)  
- Travel rhythm: Bundesliga + Champions League circuit, quarterly UK trips for England duties, recent uptick in US/Asia visits tied to brand activations and sports-tech conferences

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Club Captain & Striker, FC Bayern München (contract through 2028)  
- Captain & all-time top scorer for England Men’s National Team  
- Key achievements: 4× Golden Boot winner across Premier League & Bundesliga; FIFA “The Best” Men’s Player finalist 2024; UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- On-pitch: Deliver Bayern’s first Champions League title since 2020; maintain peak conditioning ahead of 2026 World Cup in North America  
- Off-pitch ventures:  
  • Building “EK10 Ventures” seed fund focused on performance analytics, sleep tech, and fan-engagement platforms  
  • Finalizing a partnership with ESA for a micro-gravity athletic study (low-orbit training protocols)  
- Personal: Expanding the Harry Kane Foundation’s mental-health curriculum to 500+ UK schools by 2026; learning German well enough to conduct press conferences without interpreter  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Golf handicap: 3.7; obsessed with course architecture—keeps a sketchbook of redesign ideas  
- Closet space-nerd since childhood; owns a framed Apollo 11 flight plan and collects vintage NASA patches  
- Secret creative outlet: Composes lo-fi piano pieces, uses them for pre-match visualization (rarely disclosed)  
- Guiding maxim: “Consistency is freedom—habits beat hype.” Credits Ryan Holiday’s Stoic writings for mental resilience

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Global sports icon exploring human performance in extreme environments—aligns with Planta’s “beyond-Earth” community vision  
- Seeking:  
  • Insights on cognitive effects of reduced gravity for elite athletes  
  • Collaborators to pilot immersive fan experiences using lunar-base XR feeds  
- Contribution: Massive cross-demographic reach (180 M+ social followers) to amplify Planta’s narrative; credibility to reframe space as an inclusive frontier, not a billionaire hobby

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to:  
  • NASA’s Human Performance Lab leadership  
  • SoftBank Vision Fund partners active in sports-tech and VR content  
  • Chef Massimo Bottura (interested in co-creating a “Zero-Waste Match-Day Menu”)  
- How attendees can help: Share research on circadian rhythm adaptation in space; offer beta access to biometric wearables suited for micro-gravity  
- Engage him by: Asking about his piano compositions or his ESA experiment rather than goal tallies; invite him to try a quick VR golf swing analysis on-site

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers direct, humble conversation—avoid celebrity perks chatter; child-like curiosity about engineering details plays well  
- Sensitive trigger: Past ankle injuries—frame any performance questions around recovery science, not fragility  
- Follow-up probe: Would he join a 2028 sub-orbital goodwill match broadcast? Alignment with his Foundation could unlock broad PR value
