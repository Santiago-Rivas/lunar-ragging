### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Elon Musk

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: Austin (Tesla HQ, xAI), Boca Chica / Starbase TX (SpaceX launch operations)
- Regular circuits: San Francisco (Neuralink, Boring Co.), Los Angeles (family & studio meetings), London ↔ Dubai (sovereign-fund discussions), Hebei & Shanghai (Gigafactory supply chain)
- Flight pattern: Overnight Gulfstream hops; insists on in-flight Starlink terminal to stay online

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- CEO & Lead Designer, SpaceX; Technoking & Product Architect, Tesla; Founder, xAI; Executive Chair, Neuralink; Founder, The Boring Company
- Key achievements: Rapid-reuse Falcon fleet (>350 landings), global Starlink constellation at 9,000+ sats, Tesla Model 3/Y dominance, Dojo v2 training 10 exaflops on-prem

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Starship HLS certification for NASA Artemis IV; targeting 20 T to lunar surface by Q4 2026
- Tesla “Project CyberCab” fully autonomous ride-hailing network—pilot cities locked for 2026
- xAI’s “Grok-3” multimodal model under stealth training; goal: rival GPT-6 while remaining open-source
- Scaling Powerwall 3 & Megapack LFP chemistry to buffer solar towns in emerging markets
- Personal ambition: finalize architecture for 1-million-person Mars settlement; refining closed-loop agriculture prototypes with SpaceX Life Sciences

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Active in Brazilian jiu-jitsu three mornings a week; treats sparring as systems-thinking drill
- Collects 1980s synths—occasionally composes ambient tracks for Starship cabin acoustics
- Favorite lesser-known sci-fi author: Iain M. Banks’ compatriot Ken MacLeod; quotes “The future starts in the imagination before it lands on the launchpad”
- Enjoys off-beat questions; delights in revealing that he sketched a children’s comic about lunar otters at age 12—rarely publicized

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Transport provider: SpaceX Starship slated to ferry guests & freight to Sea of Tranquility base
- Keen to evaluate Planta’s “social latency” analytics for long-duration missions and Mars habitats
- Exploring gourmet, zero-crumb food textures viable in 1/6 g; seeking culinary innovators
- Will volunteer a 15-min fireside on “Psychology of Frontier Communities” if time permits

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Chef Grant Achatz (molecular gastronomy for micro-g)  
  • Prof. Sara Seager (MIT exoplanet atmospheres—life support crossover)  
  • Sovereign Wealth Fund of Norway (green-energy finance for lunar micro-grids)  
- Attendees can assist by sharing rapid-construction materials or VR-based social cohesion studies
- Engage him by asking “What surprised you about lunar dust behavior inside Starship cabins?”—triggers animated technical stories

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers walking meetings over seated chats—even in reduced gravity
- Avoid politics, SEC filings, or X platform moderation issues; focus on engineering or big-picture civilization questions
- Subtle dietary ask: caffeine-free cola or yerba-mate variant; no alcohol before public remarks
- Follow-up data he’ll appreciate: projected oxygen recycle efficiency figures from Planta’s habitat testbed
