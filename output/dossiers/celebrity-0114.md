- Collects 19th-century botanical illustrations; name-checks Marianne North as creative inspiration
- Guiding maxim: “Tension is the enemy of expression—loosen the body, free the story.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar setting dovetails perfectly with “Orbital” world-building research; keen to absorb sensory details (lighting, acoustics, locomotion)
- Seeks candid conversation starters around: microgravity choreography, psychological impacts of isolation, and sustainable lunar agriculture
- Offers star power & narrative framing skills to Planta Network’s post-event documentary or AR recap modules

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intro to SpaceX and Axiom Studios execs for potential on-orbit filming permits
- Interested in meeting plant biologists working on closed-loop life-support—possible advisory cameo in “Orbital”
- Engage her by asking for impromptu vocal warm-up in low gravity or thoughts on staging Sondheim numbers on the Moon—she responds to playful specificity

- Prefers sincerity over fan fawning; a single incisive question beats a reel of compliments
- Sensitive area: avoids discussing paparazzi incidents or daughters’ schooling details
- Follow-up Q worth exploring: Would she direct a Lunar-filmed short if production insurance hurdles are cleared?
