- Loves small-batch coffee roasting; travels with portable hand grinder  
- Guiding principle: “Let performance speak louder than promotion.” Prefers authentic, tactic-rich conversations over hype  
- Keeps a private sketchbook—pen-and-ink stadium sketches calm her pre-event nerves  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
