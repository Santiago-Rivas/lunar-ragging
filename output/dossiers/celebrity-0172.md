### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** N’Golo Kanté

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (Al-Ittihad contract through 2026)
- Maintains apartment in London and family home in Paris; monthly hops between the three for club, media, and charity deadlines
- Off-season pattern: two low-profile weeks every June in Conakry, Guinea, mentoring local academy he funds

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Captain & midfield anchor, Al-Ittihad FC; formerly Chelsea FC & 2018 World-Cup-winning France squad
- Renowned for relentless work-rate, tactical intelligence, and near-legendary humility—global ambassador for fair play
- Co-founder, AirStride Analytics (2024): wearable sensor startup optimizing endurance output in extreme environments

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Piloting AirStride “LunaLoop” patch to study muscle-loss mitigation in micro-gravity—wants lunar-lab partners by Q1 2027
- Negotiating post-playing pathway: dual focus on high-performance data science MSc (remote, Sorbonne) and Ligue 1 coaching badges
- Expanding “Green Zone” community pitches powered by solar micro-grids in West Africa (target: 50 sites by 2028)
- Personal ambition: complete first book, “Invisible Effort,” blending faith, neuroscience, and team dynamics

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Quiet connoisseur of Japanese calligraphy; practices shodō for pre-match mindfulness
- Avid beekeeper—keeps 12 hives on London rooftop; fascinated by pollination cycles in controlled ecosystems
- Core philosophy: “Greatness is the sum of unnoticed choices” (his own phrase)
- Observes Ramadan strictly; appreciates thoughtful accommodation around dietary timing

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Athlete exploring human performance beyond Earth—perfect case study for Planta’s “social-tech-body” narrative
- Seeking: Intro to micro-gravity nutritionists and habitat designers who can integrate AirStride data streams
- Can contribute: Authentic perspective on resilience, subtle leadership, and the psychology of collective goals under extreme conditions
- Prepared to share non-public findings from recent parabolic-flight trials (VO2 max drop patterns)

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Dr. Mei Tan (NASA Human Physiology Lead)  
  • Björn Kessler (Adidas Future Lab, materials R&D)  
  • Yasmin Diallo (UN Clean Energy for Sport Initiative)
- Ways attendees can help: Co-develop pilot study using Planta’s lunar sensors; secure grant co-funding for Green Zone micro-grids
- Engaging him: Offer hands-on demo stations; invite him to small-group data deep-dives rather than large spotlight panels

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers understated settings—avoid grandiose praise; speak plainly, substantively
- Surprising fact prompt: his obsession with bee colony decision-making and its parallels to midfield spatial awareness
- Follow-up probe: willingness to stage first zero-gravity exhibition futsal match as a Planta media moment
