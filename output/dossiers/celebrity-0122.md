### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Cate Blanchett

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: Brighton, UK & Sydney’s Northern Beaches
- Maintains pied-à-terre in Los Angeles for awards season and studio meetings
- Predictable migration: European festival circuit (Cannes, Venice, Berlin) May–Sept; UNHCR field visits 2-3× year

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-Founder & Partner, Dirty Films (recent deals with Apple TV+ and A24 for prestige limited series)
- Two-time Academy Award winner; 80+ screen & stage credits spanning blockbuster franchises to experimental theatre
- Goodwill Ambassador, UNHCR; vocal advocate for climate-positive production standards

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- In post-production on directorial debut, an eco-thriller shot carbon-neutral in Iceland; eyeing 2026 festival premiere
- Negotiating financing for a mixed-reality adaptation of “Orlando” that merges volumetric capture with live performance
- Family focus: twin sons entering secondary school; sourcing short-term tutoring options compatible with film schedule
- Personal study: completing certification in regenerative agriculture—intends to convert Australian family farm into a research demo site within 12 months

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Avid collector of mid-century Scandinavian lighting; can identify designers at a glance
- Late-night hobby: bakes sourdough rye using 50-year-old starter gifted by Werner Herzog
- Guiding maxim: “Imagination without responsibility is vandalism.”
- Reads quantum physics pop-science to relax; fascinated by decoherence parallels with acting “beats”
- Unusual fact to surface for CONVERSATION_GOALS: secret amateur radio license—can operate HF bands and once bounced a signal off the ISS for fun

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending as narrative architect for Planta’s “Human Stories Off-World” short-form series; scouting lunar setting for episode #0
- Seeking dialogue on closed-loop food systems adaptable to film sets & refugee camps alike
- Brings storytelling cachet, media visibility, and ability to frame lunar habitation in emotionally resonant language

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired:
  • Dr. Alexis Morgan (ESA space-architect) on habitat acoustics  
  • Patagonia’s Venture Fund re: regenerative textiles for costume departments  
  • MIT Media Lab’s Responsive Environments group to refine XR capture on low-gravity surfaces
- High-value give: willing to host on-camera “table read” in lunar base to amplify Planta’s mission
- Engagement tips: open with design or lighting references; offer hands-on demos—she prefers tactile exploration over slide decks

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid clichés about awards or “Galadriel”—she hears them hourly
- Sensitive topic: keeps family life fiercely private; steer clear of children’s names/locations
- Follow-up question: How did her ham-radio passion start, and could she imagine a lunar-based broadcast performance piece?
