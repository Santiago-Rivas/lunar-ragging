### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Brendan Eich

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Redwood City, CA (Silicon Valley corridor)  
- Maintains satellite office presence in Austin, TX and occasional quarters in Zürich for EU privacy work  
- Travel pattern: quarterly EU trips for regulatory consultations; regular speaking slots at Web3, privacy, and ad-tech summits across Asia-Pacific  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & CEO, Brave Software – 65 M+ monthly active users; champion of privacy-by-design browsing, ad-tech disruption, and crypto-powered rewards (Basic Attention Token, BAT)  
- Creator of JavaScript; co-founded Mozilla & Firefox, cementing open-source credibility  
- Influential voice on W3C TAG and US/EC digital policy roundtables  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Rolling out Brave’s AI-native search assistant (“Leo”) with on-device LLM inference to avoid server-side data collection  
- Negotiating cross-chain BAT interoperability with Solana and Polygon to broaden creator payouts  
- Investigating “edge compute satellites” partnership for latency-free web access in remote or off-planet locales  
- Personally funding a stealth project on verifiable credentials for minors’ online safety—goal: open standard by Q4 2026  
- Health kick: VR-guided high-intensity interval training; prepping for partial-gravity impact on cardiovascular function ahead of the lunar trip  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur pianist; prefers late-night jazz improvisation over formal receptions  
- Collects first-edition science-fiction novels (Asimov’s “The Gods Themselves” is always in his carry-on)  
- Guiding maxim: “The user is the product only if we design it that way.”  
- Enjoys counter-intuitive trivia—e.g., patterns in J.L. Austin’s speech-act theory inform his API naming conventions  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a testbed for “off-Earth web” concepts—lunar mesh networks, tokenized resource allocation, zero-gravity UX  
- Seeks candid discussion on how micro-payments and attention markets translate in bandwidth-scarce environments  
- Offers deep expertise in building user-centric protocols, plus a 10-person Brave R&D team on standby for joint lunar-net experiments  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Lunar Communications Office, SpaceX Starlink interplanetary relay leads, MIT Media Lab’s Space Exploration Initiative  
- Could benefit from chefs’ insights on sensory perception shifts in low gravity for adaptive UI design (sound & haptics over visuals)  
- Engage him with a surprising statistics puzzle or a rapid piano duet—he warms quickly to playful intellectual challenges  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive history: 2014 Mozilla CEO resignation; avoid US culture-war topics—he pivots to product talk if pressed  
- Prefers direct, efficiency-oriented exchanges; summarize proposals in 90 seconds, then drill into cryptographic detail  
- Follow-up questions:  
  1. Status of Brave’s satellite edge compute pilot with Swarm Technologies  
  2. Interest level in co-authoring a “Lunar Web Manifesto” white paper post-event
