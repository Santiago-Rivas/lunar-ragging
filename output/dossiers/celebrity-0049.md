### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Art Garfunkel

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Upper West Side, Manhattan; keeps a quiet retreat in Carmel, CA
- Habitual “walking sabbaticals” — spends weeks mapping city grids on foot or trekking rural routes (has logged >18,000 miles across the U.S. and Europe)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Iconic vocalist, one-half of Simon & Garfunkel; 8× Grammy winner & Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee
- Continues selective solo tours in acoustically distinctive venues; recent appearances paired with string quartets to explore “chamber-folk”
- Adjunct lecturer, Columbia University “Sound & Silence” master class (sporadic pop-ups since 2023)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Curating a 60th-anniversary box set (2026) featuring unreleased Central Park rehearsal tapes and newly penned liner essays on friendship & fracture
- Drafting a second memoir focused on his lifelong reading log (now 1,385 books) and the intellectual discipline behind it
- Exploring immersive audio tech; experimenting with spatial-audio poetry recitations for VR libraries
- Personal aim: one final continent-spanning walk (Cape Town to Cairo, slated for late 2027) to cap his “pilgrim trilogy”

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate about pure mathematics puzzles; carries a pocket moleskine filled with number theory scribbles
- Maintains a baritone recorder habit; practices lullabies to keep lung elasticity
- Guiding maxim: “Distance clears the eye, harmony clears the heart.”
- Surprising fact: performed anonymous late-night poetry readings in NYC subway stations throughout 2024 to test “voice without fame”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence lends multigenerational cultural gravitas; keen to gauge how lunar acoustics alter vocal resonance
- Wants to meet acoustic engineers and neuroscientists studying music’s effect on circadian adjustment in low-gravity habitats
- Prepared to offer an impromptu a cappella rendition of “April Come She Will,” adapted to lunar echo, as a sonic experiment
- Seeking inspiration for a prospective song cycle titled “Sea of Tranquility Diaries”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Introductions desired: Planta’s XR soundscape team, ESA psychoacoustics lead Dr. Léa Dubois, and any mission planners charting lunar walking trails
- Attendees can assist by sharing field notes on sensory perception in off-Earth environments or providing datasets on lunar reverberation times
- Engagement tip: open with an unexpected book recommendation; he notes them meticulously and often mails a thank-you postcard quoting the text

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Mild hearing sensitivity — prefers conversation at ≤70 dB; avoid background music when speaking
- Unresolved question worth exploring: Will NASA allow non-mission civilians to log “official” lunar walks? He wants the first recorded artistic promenade
- Expresses subtle regret over limited STEM outreach in his career; may respond enthusiastically to proposals blending music with space education initiatives
