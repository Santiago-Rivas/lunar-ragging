### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Cheng Wei

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Beijing, China (Chaoyang District HQ of DiDi Global Inc.)
- Secondary residence in Singapore to facilitate ASEAN expansion and family privacy
- Regular rotation: Beijing ⇆ San Francisco (AV R&D hub) ⇆ Singapore every 6-8 weeks; quarterly trips to Abu Dhabi & Riyadh for sovereign-fund partnerships

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Executive Chairman, DiDi Global Inc.—world’s largest multi-modal mobility platform (ride-hailing, robo-taxis, EV charging, urban logistics)
- Steering committee member, China National Autonomous Driving Standardization Alliance
- Co-initiator of the “Moon Mobility Consortium” (MMC) exploring low-gravity transport design with JAXA, ESA, and private launch providers

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a $6 B strategic round to spin out DiDi Autonomous into a global robo-taxi network by 2026
- Accelerating in-house solid-state battery production; goal: 500 Wh/kg packs in mass market EVs by Q4 2025
- Personally championing “Transit for Terrains Without Roads” — AI-driven, modular pods for disaster zones and, eventually, extraterrestrial habitats
- Quietly funding a scholarship program for rural Chinese students in planetary science; aims to send first beneficiary to NASA internship in 2027

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur Chinese calligrapher; meditates via brushwork at dawn—believes the practice “sets the stroke for every strategic decision”
- Weekend rock climber; fascinated by micro-gravity biomechanics
- Guiding philosophy: “Solve for movement, and you solve for opportunity”
- Surprisingly adept barista—studied espresso extraction curves during COVID lockdowns; enjoys blind latte art contests

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Expertise in large-scale mobility ecosystems complements Planta’s vision of fluid social connectivity on the Moon
- Seeking dialogue on: 
  • Micro-gravity passenger safety standards  
  • Closed-loop energy grids powered by lunar regolith-derived solar panels  
  • Cross-jurisdictional data governance for interplanetary networks
- Can contribute: Real-time routing algorithms, fleet operations telemetry, and lessons from managing 60 M daily rides on Earth

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable introductions:  
  • SpaceX Starship cargo scheduling team (rideshare logistics)  
  • European Space Agency’s Habitat Materials lead (lunar surface infrastructure)  
  • Chef-astronaut Charles Duke III (space-adaptive food service design)
- Ways attendees can help: Share insights on psychological comfort in confined environments—data DiDi can apply to long-haul robo-pod interiors
- Engagement suggestions: Invite him to a quick latte throw-down using low-gravity coffee rigs; transition into discussion on human-centered design

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Avoid public probing into 2021-22 Chinese regulatory investigations; he remains cautious on data-security topics unless in closed session
- Prefers concise, metric-rich dialogue; appreciates direct asks followed by clear timelines
- Follow-up question aligned with host’s goal: “Few know you can free-pour a perfect rosetta in zero G—how did that obsession start?”
