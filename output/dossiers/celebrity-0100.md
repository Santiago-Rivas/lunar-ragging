### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Viola Davis

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Toluca Lake, Los Angeles
- Maintains family property in Central Falls, Rhode Island; retreats there for memoir work
- Travels on a neatly planned six-week rotation between LA (studio meetings), New York (Broadway scouting), and Atlanta (post-production hub for JuVee films)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-Founder & Co-CEO, JuVee Productions—slate of film, TV, and immersive-media projects centered on historically overlooked voices
- Only Black performer to achieve acting “EGOT” status; Academy Award, Emmy, two Tonys, Grammy audiobook win (2025)
- Influence vector: industry gatekeeper for equity-minded production financing; advised by McKinsey’s Inclusive Storytelling Lab

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Packaging an Afro-futurist limited series (“Lunar Queen”) with Apple TV+, blending real moon-base science and mythic folklore
- Raising a $75 M impact fund (JuVee Impact Stories Fund) targeting women-led XR start-ups
- Finalizing pre-production on “The Woman King: Rebellion” sequel; aims 60% below-the-line crew from African nations
- Personal: Studying horticulture and regenerative farming as a metaphor for food sovereignty; hands-on apprenticeship at Ron Finley’s urban garden collective

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Secret hobby: Hand-tunes vintage record players—swears vinyl collects “ancestral memory”
- Fitness anchor: Early-morning Krav Maga sparring; says controlled combat “centers the chaos”
- Guiding philosophy: “Art is activism’s megaphone—if people feel, they’ll move.”
- Often quotes Harriet Tubman’s line: “I freed a thousand slaves; I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner’s symbolism: shared meal in a place once thought unreachable—mirrors her mission to place marginalized stories in impossible spaces
- Seeking collaborators who can integrate volumetric capture on the lunar surface for episode one of “Lunar Queen”
- Curious about Planta’s social-connectivity tech as an antidote to Earth-side isolation—potential integration into JuVee’s “digital village” platform
- Can offer global media amplification, documentary coverage, and star power to galvanize public interest in lunar civics and cultural heritage

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros: NASA Artemis outreach team, SpaceX cinematic ops, Tribeca Immersive curators, Patagonia’s social-impact fund (for regenerative farming tie-in)
- Attendees can assist with: on-site volumetric rigs, grant pathways for STEAM programs in under-resourced U.S. school districts, distribution partners for African markets
- Engagement tips: Open with a question about the most transformative meal she’s ever had; segue into food insecurity and space-grown agriculture—she lights up instantly

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- She values radical honesty; superficial flattery disengages her within seconds
- Prefers private reflection corners between high-energy moments—offer a brief quiet demo of Planta’s biosensing garden pods
- Follow-up questions: 1) What narrative rights are still unclaimed for “hidden figures” in early space history? 2) Would she cameo as executive producer on a short filmed entirely in lunar zero-G kitchen?
