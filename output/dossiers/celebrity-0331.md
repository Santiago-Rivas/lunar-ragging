- Travels quarterly to Singapore & São Paulo to oversee emerging-market strategy; has quietly booked several parabolic-flight sessions with Axiom Space to acclimate to micro-gravity

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Spearheading L’Oréal’s “Epidermis 2030” program: lab-grown collagen and recycled-carbon packaging aimed at 90% biodegradability within five years  
- Negotiating minority stakes in two space-biotech startups researching stem-cell proliferation in micro-gravity—objective: patentable anti-aging actives unique to extraterrestrial labs  
- Personal 2025-2026 goal: publish a modern commentary on the Book of Revelation, linking scriptural eschatology to climate stewardship  
- Privately studying Mandarin (daily tutor sessions) to deepen direct ties with Chinese consumer base and regulators

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Classical pianist—composes nocturnes under the pseudonym “F. Lys”; first suite to debut at Fondation Louis Vuitton fall 2026  
- Keeps a small astrophotography observatory on Brittany coast; favorite target: Messier 13 cluster  
- Guiding maxim: “Beauty that endures must honor the planet that hosts it.”  
- Enjoys surprise micro-meetups with young chemists; insists the best ideas “arrive unannounced from the lab bench”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending to explore how human rituals (meals, self-care, art) translate off-planet; evaluates potential for a L’Oréal “LunaLab” within the Sea of Tranquility base  
- Seeking dialogue on closed-loop water reclamation for cosmetic production and on sensory design of fragrances in low-pressure habitats  
- Brings expertise in branding luxury experiences; can advise Planta on crafting emotionally resonant narratives around lunar life

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired:  
  • Dr. S. Patel, NASA’s Advanced Life-Support Systems lead (water & biomass recycling)  
  • Venture partner at Starbound Capital (space biotech fund)  
- Offer to mentor: early-stage founders merging wellness, sustainability, and extraterrestrial tech  
- Engagement tip: Ask about the parallels she sees between biblical creation stories and humanity’s expansion off-world—triggers passionate, reflective conversation

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Highly private; avoids discussing past family litigations— steer clear  
- Prefers low-light, intimate settings over spotlit stages; likely to linger by any art installation or live music corner  
- Follow-up questions for post-event call:  
  1. Interest level in co-funding a zero-gravity fermentation module for Planta Network?  
  2. Parameters for L’Oréal’s first limited “Moon Edition” skincare line—packaging, co-branding, distribution rights.
