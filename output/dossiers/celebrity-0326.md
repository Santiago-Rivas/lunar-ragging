### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Black belt in Taekwondo; starts every board meeting with a 90-second breathing kata
- Obsessed with antique nautical charts—sees “old maps of uncharted waters” as analog to digital asset frontiers
- Guiding maxim: “Transparency creates trust; trust creates liquidity.”
- Surprising fact she rarely shares: Spent a college summer apprenticing at a molecular-chocolate lab in Paris, still experiments with zero-gravity tempering techniques

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevant as financial infrastructure visionary for off-world commerce; eager to test-drive Planta’s social connectivity layer for cross-planetary trading floors
