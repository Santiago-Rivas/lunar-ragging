### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Esther Lafferty

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Oxford, U.K.; splits time between London’s creative districts and periodic residencies in rural Wales for “deep-work” retreats  
- Annual travel circuit: Venice Biennale, SXSW, and Tokyo Art Week—tracks emerging immersive-tech talent across continents  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Festival Director, Oxfordshire Artweeks (largest open-studio event in the U.K., >1,000 artists/150k visitors)  
- Founder, Liminal Canvas Ltd. – boutique consultancy curating site-specific art/tech experiences for brands like Dyson and ESA  
- Key achievements  
  • Pioneered U.K.’s first holographic sculpture trail (2023)  
  • 2024 British Council “Creative Innovator” fellow for cross-cultural arts diplomacy  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling Artweeks’ hybrid model—integrating AR wayfinding and carbon-tracking for 2026 festival rollout  
- Negotiating a co-production with the European Space Agency to place a micro-gallery aboard Lunar Gateway (“creativity as mission psychology tool”)  
- Personal: writing a book, “Gravity of Imagination,” exploring how off-planet living reshapes aesthetic perception—deadline Q3 2026  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Practicing freediver; uses breath-control techniques to teach artists “flow state on demand” workshops  
- Collects vintage scent bottles—believes olfactory memory is the next frontier of immersive storytelling  
- Guiding philosophy: “Art is infrastructure for empathy—build it wherever you go.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: among the few curators actively prototyping art for extraterrestrial environments—natural fit for a lunar social experiment  
- Seeking collaborators to test multisensory installations in 1/6 g; interest in Planta Network’s haptic-feedback protocols  
- Can contribute a mini pop-up “scent of Earth” exhibit to spark nostalgic dialogue during dinner; additive PR value for event narrative  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to:  
  • SpaceX experiential marketing team (for payload sponsorship)  
  • Michelin-star chef Rasmus Munk (for gastro-art co-creation)  
  • Any VCs funding “culture-tech” or “space tourism wellbeing” verticals  
- Attendees can assist by sharing data on human emotional responses in partial gravity—she’ll fold insights into ESA proposal  
- Engagement tips: invite her to brainstorm a 30-second artistic ritual for the table; she loves rapid, co-creative challenges  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Surprising personal fact to surface: secretly designs cryptic crosswords for The Guardian under the pseudonym “Apogee”  
- Sensitive consideration: fiercely protective of artists’ IP; ensure any collaboration terms are clear & equitable  
- Follow-up queries: status of Planta’s scent-diffusion tech certification for closed habitats; interest level in hosting a post-event open call for lunar-inspired artworks.
