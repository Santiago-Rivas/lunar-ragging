### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Matt Bellamy

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: Lake Como, Italy & Los Angeles, CA; maintains a studio retreat in Teignmouth, Devon
- Regularly hops between Europe and the U.S. West Coast on a three-week rotation; tends to tack on detours to Tokyo or Austin when new audio hardware debuts

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Lead vocalist, guitarist, and principal songwriter, Muse (40 M+ albums sold, 2 × Grammy “Best Rock Album”)
- Co-founder, Helium 3 Publishing & Charcoal Records; early investor in Luminet Haptics (XR wearables) and Ampere Clean Energy Fund
- Composer for upcoming Apple TV+ sci-fi miniseries “Event Horizon: 2186” slated for 2026

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finishing Muse’s ninth studio album—recorded partly in 360-audio to enable personalized spatial mixes for head-tracked earbuds (release Q4 2025)
- Prototyping a low-latency, holographic “twin stage” that syncs a live arena show with a simultaneous VR moon-base feed
- Personally piloting a light jet to obtain suborbital flight certification; aims to perform the first guitar solo above the Kármán line
- Quietly researching regenerative farming for his family vineyard near Lucca; exploring biochar to offset future tour emissions

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects Cold-War space memorabilia and rare Soviet Theremins; often breaks the ice by letting guests try a pocket-sized Theremini he keeps in his jacket
- Recreational falconer—says raptor training sharpens stage reflexes
- Guiding belief: “Civilizations thrive when art and engineering share the same sketchpad.”
- Unexpected quirk: has an amateur patent pending for a carbon-fiber pick that doubles as a “nano-bow” for violin-style guitar sustains

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar setting aligns with Muse’s longstanding space-opera themes; eager to test how low gravity affects resonance and feedback loops
- Seeking conversations on synesthetic dining—pairing frequencies with flavor profiles for immersive culinary concerts
- Brings a compact acoustic-piezzo rig capable of recording ambient lunar vibrations for a hidden track on the new album

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Would value introductions to: Planta’s sensor engineering leads (for integrating bio-feedback into live shows), Blue Origin flight operations (orbital performance logistics), and Michelin-starred chef Mei Lin (synesthetic menu collaboration)
- Could mentor younger artists on rights retention and immersive touring economics
- Engagement tips: open with a physics or wine question, then pivot to music tech; invite him to a behind-the-scenes tour of the lunar kitchen’s acoustic insulation—he will want to strum and test reverb

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid probing past tabloid relationships; focus on future-forward topics
- Strong preference for hands-on demos—have a tactile prototype or diagram ready
- Follow-up queries: Would he license lunar ambient recordings to Planta’s app? Interest in co-developing a zero-g audience feedback glove?
