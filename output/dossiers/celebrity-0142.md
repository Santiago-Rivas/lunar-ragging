### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Maggie Cheung Man-yuk

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: Paris 11ᵉ (creative loft) & Hong Kong (family and commercial work)
- Regular one-month residencies in Kyoto for silent meditation/print-making
- Routinely adds 2–3 days of unannounced “city drift” whenever flying long-haul—observes street rhythms for creative reference

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Iconic, multi-award-winning film actor (Cannes, Berlin, Hong Kong Film Awards); shifted to producer/director role since 2023
- Founder, Lunar Lab Pictures – boutique studio developing genre-bending, environmentally themed features and immersive XR pieces
- UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for Intangible Cultural Heritage; patron of Hong Kong Philharmonic’s new music incubator

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Completing first feature as director: “Still Water, Still Moon,” a Sino-French eco-sci-fi drama shooting fall 2025
- Raising €15 M finishing fund; exploring in-camera VFX and AI-assisted storyboarding workflows
- Personal mission: nurture pan-Asian female talent behind the camera—running a 6-month mentorship cohort in 2026
- Training for her second 100 km desert ultramarathon; channels endurance sports discipline into on-set leadership

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects 1960s space-age vinyl; spins surprise DJ sets under alias “M.Y. Velvet”
- Philosophy: “Silence is dialogue’s best co-writer”—often builds entire scenes around pauses
- Fascinated by mycological materials; keeps a micro-lab in Paris experimenting with mushroom-based leather for costumes
- Surprising fact she enjoys sharing: fluent in Shanghainese sign language, picked up while researching a 2004 role

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as living research for “Still Water, Still Moon” and its low-gravity dream sequence
- Wants candid conversations on designing human rituals in extraterrestrial habitats—particularly food, music, and scent
- Can contribute star power, storytelling expertise, and a short-form art film documenting the event’s sensory palette
- Intends to capture binaural audio of the base’s ambient hum for her film score

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Seeks warm intros to: 
  • SpaceX/Starship life-support designers (set authenticity)  
  • LVMH sustainability lab (fungal leather partnership)  
  • Private Asian impact funds interested in eco-cinema
- Open to advising Planta on narrative framing and celebrity engagement for future off-world experiences
- Best engagement tactic: ask for her opinion on how silence and micro-gravity could reshape cinematic language—she’ll light up

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers small-group settings; large photo ops drain her quickly—secure a quiet alcove or post-dinner walk
- Avoid questions about personal relationships; focus on craft and future-minded topics
- Follow-up queries: progress on AR companion piece to “Still Water, Still Moon”; interest in curating a lunar film festival pop-up during Artemis IV window
