### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Nora Lum (professionally: Awkwafina)

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: Los Angeles (Silver Lake) & Queens, NYC (Astoria apartment maintained for family ties)
- Quarterly stays in Vancouver & Atlanta for studio shoots; deliberately tacks on “quiet weeks” in Kyoto for writing sprints

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Multi-hyphenate: actor, writer-producer, rapper; founder, Yellow Pony Productions (first-look deal with A24)
- Breakout roles: “The Farewell” (Golden Globe), “Crazy Rich Asians,” Marvel’s “Shang-Chi”; voice of Sisu in Disney’s “Raya”
- Emmy-nominated creator & star, “Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens” (Season 4 in pre-production)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Building a comedy-forward genre slate—first sci-fi satire “LOOPHOLE” set on a privatized space station (development funds raised Q1 2025)
- Launching an audio imprint to revive her hip-hop persona with 2026 concept album “LUNAR PALATE” featuring multi-language collabs
- Expanding philanthropic initiative “A-Game Labs” to mentor Asian-American youth in screenwriting and stand-up
- Personal goal: earn a private pilot license; long-term ambition to direct a feature before 2028

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobbies: vintage Moog synthesizers, speed chess (1800 online rating), hot-sauce home brewing
- Collects 1950s pulp sci-fi magazines—draws comedic beats from their “campy optimism”
- Guiding philosophy: “Comedy disarms before it disrupts”
- Little-known fact: played trumpet on two underground jazz records during college; still practices scales nightly to clear creative blocks

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: celebrity voice that bridges mainstream pop culture with future-tech storytelling; actively researching zero-G performance logistics for LOOPHOLE
- Seeks informal brainstorming on immersive audience interfaces—how to fold live lunar footage into streaming comedy specials
- Offers infectious humor, a talent for demystifying tech for broad audiences, and a 40 M-strong social following to amplify Planta’s lunar narrative

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: SpaceX production liaison teams, Unreal Engine devs specializing in volumetric capture, Michelin-level chefs experimenting with hydroponic ingredients
- Could mentor emerging creatives at the event’s satellite hackathon; open to cameo in attendees’ VR demos if they “make her laugh in 30 seconds”
- Best engagement tactic: prompt her with an off-beat “What if…?” scenario—she ideates punchlines and narrative hooks on the spot

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers conversational spontaneity; scripted talking points stall her energy
- Sensitive to tokenization—ensure discussions on representation center agency, not obligation
- Surprising personal tidbit worth asking: her side quest to perfect a plant-based Hainanese chicken rice using lab-grown fat cultures
- Follow-up intel to gather: rights availability window for LOOPHOLE ancillary experiences (game, graphic novel)
