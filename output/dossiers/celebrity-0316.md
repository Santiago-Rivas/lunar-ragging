### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Mark Cuban

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Dallas, TX  
- Orbiting hubs: Los Angeles (Shark Tank shoots), New York (media & fintech deal flow), Boca Chica, TX (quarterly site visits to Starship facilities)  
- Known for rapid-turn, same-day travel when diligence requires face-to-face debate

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Lead investor, Radical Investments LLC; syndicates ≈40 early-stage deals per year across healthtech, AI, and spacecommerce  
- Founder & CEO, Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company—disrupting U.S. generics pricing; 4.6 M active patients (Q1 2025)  
- Long-term governor, Dallas Mavericks (retained sporting operations after 2023 majority sale); pioneer of direct-to-consumer sports streaming

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling Cost Plus Drugs into telehealth bundles; piloting AI dosage-optimization with Mayo Clinic  
- Mapping opportunities for low-orbit or lunar pharma manufacturing to bypass Earth contamination constraints  
- Evaluating immersive fan-engagement tech ahead of NBA’s 2028 media-rights reset  
- Personal 2025-26 agenda: post-sale liquidity redeployed into space logistics, protein-printing, and longevity startups

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Maintains a private “code hour” before dawn; still writes Python prototypes for diligence  
- Collects vintage snare drums—keeps a 1959 Ludwig at every residence; claims 10-minute morning rudiments boost neuroplasticity (his “unusual fact” for small talk)  
- Guiding maxim: “Sweat the math, then set it on fire with storytelling.”  
- Fan of long-form sci-fi essays; will quote Neal Stephenson when discussing systems engineering

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn by Planta’s vision of social infrastructure beyond Earth—mirrors his thesis that “experience is the next scarce asset”  
- Wants candid data on lunar supply-chain costs (power, water, latency) to scope micro-gravity drug compounding and zero-g sports exhibitions  
- Brings broadcast reach (165 M Shark Tank viewers) and a ready SPV for off-world entertainment ventures

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • NASA commercial procurement leads (lunar life-science)  
  • SpaceX or Blue Origin habitat engineering teams  
  • Michelin-tier chefs experimenting with 3D-printed or algae-based cuisine  
- Attendees can assist by sharing prototypes that compress latency for real-time Earth-Moon fan engagement; he’ll trade feedback and funding  
- Best engagement tactic: hit him with a concrete unit-economics table, then pivot to an audacious “what if” scenario

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Dislikes buzzword bingo—expects precise numbers within two decimal places  
- Shows genuine curiosity for mental-health impacts of prolonged lunar stays; probing for investable wellness tech  
- Follow-up Qs:  
  1. Would he commit Mavericks branding to a 2030 lunar exhibition game?  
  2. Threshold ROI he needs to green-light a Cost Plus micro-gravity pilot line in 2027?
