### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Chris Evert

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Boca Raton, Florida; maintains a retreat ranch outside Aspen for altitude training & family get-togethers  
- Predictable annual circuit: Melbourne (January), Paris (May/June), London (July), New York (August/September) for Grand Slam commentary and academy scouting trips  
- Recently added quarterly visits to Seattle & San Jose to meet immersive-tech partners developing remote tennis coaching tools  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Lead Analyst, ESPN Grand Slam coverage; draws ~2.6 M average viewers per telecast  
- Co-owner, Evert Tennis Academy (240+ student-athletes; 87 NCAA Division I alumni)  
- Chair, Women’s Sports Equity Fund (raised $38 M since 2023 for prize-money parity and coaching opportunities)  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Launching “EvertPlay,” an XR tennis-training platform using haptic racquets; beta slated for Q4 2025  
- Building an international scholarship program for young female players from conflict zones (first cohort: Ukraine, Sudan, Gaza)  
- Personal: post-cancer wellness advocacy—collaborating with Johns Hopkins on early detection AI for BRCA-negative ovarian cancer cases  
- Writing a memoir-plus-mental-fitness guide; working title “Quiet Shoulders, Ferocious Heart,” due 2026  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Loves designing herb gardens; claims fresh basil is her real pre-match “secret weapon”  
- Collects vintage jazz vinyl; Ella Fitzgerald and Dave Brubeck accompany her morning stretch routine  
- Philosophical anchor: “Pressure is a privilege” (Billie Jean King). She adds, “Only in silence do you hear the heartbeat of a point.”  
- Enjoys brainstorming “zero-g sports drills” and has sketched a lunar-court layout where serves become slo-mo ballet—happy to share doodles  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Moon dinner as a metaphor for smashing ceilings—literal and figurative—around women in sport and exploration  
- Seeking collaborators who can adapt EvertPlay for extreme environments (space stations, polar bases) to demonstrate how movement builds community anywhere humans settle  
- Curious about bone-density nutrition research for long-duration missions; sees parallel benefits for aging athletes  
- Will contribute stories on competitive mindset under atypical conditions and lead an informal “micro-gravity swing clinic” if space permits  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired:  
  • NASA Human Performance Lab (exercise protocols)  
  • Unity & Unreal Engine execs focused on sports modules  
  • Philanthropists keen on girls’ athletics + STEM crossover initiatives  
- She thrives in intimate, idea-driven chats—suggest seating her next to biomechanists or food-tech innovators rather than entertainment personalities  
- Gift-worthy gesture: a small vial of lunar regolith earmarked for the first tennis court lines—symbolizes joint future project  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers candor; will disengage if conversation feels performative or hero-worshipping  
- Rarely mentioned: practices Zen calligraphy; one unfinished kanji (“ma” – negative space) is always in her carry-on—ask to see it  
- Post-event follow-up: gauge interest in a co-produced docuseries “Gravity Games” chronicling adaptation of classic sports on the Moon and Mars
