### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Tim Cook

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Cupertino, CA (Apple Park); maintains apartment in New York’s Tribeca for East-Coast meetings
- Predictable circuit: Shanghai → Shenzhen → Cupertino every 8 weeks to inspect supply-chain sustainability projects
- Annual personal retreats: National parks—especially Zion and Glacier—for digital detox and trail running

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chief Executive Officer, Apple Inc. (since 2011); spearheaded Apple Silicon, Vision Pro, and global privacy framework
- Architect of Apple’s 2030 carbon-neutral supply chain, now influential across Fortune 100 manufacturing
- Board member, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights; quiet angel investor in assistive-tech startups

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Guiding 2026 launch of Vision Pro 2 with “Spatial Collaboration” feature aimed at enterprise & education
- Finalizing non-invasive glucose sensor for Apple Watch 11; sees healthcare as Apple’s “next mountain”
- Mentoring succession bench (Jeff Williams, Johny Srouji, Deirdre O’Brien) while planning post-CEO philanthropic pivot focused on rural broadband and STEM equity
- Personal: training for the 2026 Berlin Marathon; experimenting with regenerative-farm partnerships to supply Apple Park cafés

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects vintage NASA mission patches and quotes Gene Kranz’s “failure is not an option” in leadership talks
- Weekend cyclist; uses TestFlight versions of Fitness+ “outdoor ride” metrics to give UX feedback
- Favorite conversation turn: civil-rights history in Alabama and how it informs corporate responsibility
- Guiding principle: “Technology should preserve human dignity, not diminish it.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending to explore how spatial computing can enhance social bonding in low-gravity environments
- Looking for data on sensory perception shifts on the Moon to refine Vision Pro’s adaptive audio/visual pipeline
- Offers unparalleled expertise in seamless device ecosystems, privacy-centric communications, and satellite-based emergency services—critical for off-planet habitats
- Curious about Planta’s approach to “digital-first empathy” and potential SDK hooks for Apple developers

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: NASA Artemis UX team, SpaceX Starshield comms leads, Chef-scientists studying taste modulation in microgravity
- Attendees can help by sharing lunar habitat UI pain points, raw biometric datasets, or case studies on social isolation countermeasures
- Best engagement tactic: invite him to a brief “thought-walk” around the observation dome, then demo a live mixed-reality prototype; keep it under 10 minutes and data-rich

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Reserve discussions on Apple Car or M&A rumors—he shuts down speculative chatter quickly
- Prefers prepared, quantitative questions; follows up diligently when presented with clear action items
- Surprising personal detail he rarely shares: maintains a small workshop at home restoring 1930s American hand tools—finds precision machining “meditative”
- Potential follow-up: ask if Apple Fitness+ would pilot a “Lunar Workouts” series featuring astronaut coaching data
