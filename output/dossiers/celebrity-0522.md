- Lifelong metallurgy geek; collects meteorite slices and can identify iron-nickel patterns by eye
- Completed three zero-gravity parabolic flights; describes micro-g as “the purest empathy exercise—everyone’s equally untethered”
- Philosophy: “Proximity creates accountability.” Believes tech should shrink emotional, not physical, distance
- Weekend decompression: trail running on Mt. Tam with a rotating pack of female founder friends

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Dinner Party as a live experiment in forging communal bonds in extreme, resource-constrained settings

- Brings expertise in scaling trust systems, plus access to capital earmarked for lunar-adjacent civic tech pilots

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers data-backed conversations but lights up at personal anecdotes of community serendipity
- Sensitive topic: she quietly funds peace-building initiatives in Belfast; avoid politicized Brexit angles unless she raises them
- Follow-up Q: status of her “Frontier Communities” fund limited-partner lineup—potential co-investment slot for Planta if timelines align
