### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Pablo Martín “Gavi” Páez Gavira

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Barcelona, Spain (club HQ & residence in Pedralbes)
- Regular hops to Madrid (national team training) and Doha (Qatar-based performance clinic)
- Vacation pattern: short, unscheduled escapes to the Canary Islands for freediving and anonymity

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Midfield talisman, FC Barcelona & Spanish National Team; youngest to 100 appearances for Barça
- 2022 Golden Boy & Kopa Trophy winner; Adidas global ambassador
- Co-founder, PitchShift Labs – a stealth venture building mixed-reality fan experiences for live sports

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Accelerated knee-ligament rehab targeting full match fitness by August 2025
- Negotiating image-rights carve-outs to back PitchShift’s €25 M seed round without club conflicts
- Designing a “smart boot” with pressure sensors to monitor joint stress in real time
- Personal ambition: learn conversational Japanese ahead of Barcelona’s 2026 Tokyo showcase

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate about electronics tinkering—built his own micro-satellite tracker in a spare bedroom
- Collects first-edition sci-fi paperbacks; favorite line: “El futuro pertenece a los valientes”
- Uses deep-breathing freediving drills to reset focus pre-match
- Unusual fact he rarely shares: writes flamenco guitar compositions under the alias “Mar de Cobre”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a live testbed for zero-latency holographic fan interactions—wants to gauge Planta’s mesh-network tech for stadium deployment
- Curious about nutritional demands of low-gravity environments to translate insights into high-altitude match prep
- Offers global reach (56 M social followers) to spotlight Planta’s mission; happy to record a short in-situ promo from the lunar dome
- Looking for partners to co-develop VR “player-perspective” content that streams in 8K with minimal motion sickness

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable introductions: 
  • Dr. Mei Liao (CTO, HoloNet Systems) for volumetric capture  
  • Aaron Patel (Managing Partner, Zenith Sports Venture Fund) for PitchShift Series A  
  • ESA kinesiologists studying muscle atrophy mitigation
- Attendees can assist with satellite spectrum licensing for real-time match data relay
- Engagement tips: open with tech or music rather than football; ask how flamenco phrasing influences his passing rhythms

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Media fatigue—prefers off-record chats; approach without cameras initially
- Highly loyal to Barça; avoid any “Premier League” transfer hypotheticals
- Follow-up: invite him to demo PitchShift at Planta’s Barcelona R&D studio post-event
