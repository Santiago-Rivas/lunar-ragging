**FULL NAME:** Dustin Moskovitz

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: San Francisco Bay Area (resides in Noe Valley; Asana HQ in Mission District)
- Regular circuits: Washington DC (policy), New York (philanthropy), Zürich (AI-safety labs), annual 10-day Vipassana retreat in rural Massachusetts
- Avoids “conference treadmill”; prefers 3–4 high-leverage events per year

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & CEO, Asana (NYSE: ASAN) – $700 M ARR work-management platform now embedding proprietary “AI teammate” copilots
- Facebook co-founder; retains ~1.5% stake via trust structures
- Co-chair, Good Ventures & Open Philanthropy – directs $700 M+/yr toward global health, AI risk, and animal welfare

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Steering Asana’s transition from task manager to autonomous workflows; closing strategic partnership with Microsoft Graph in Q3 2025
- Scaling Open Philanthropy’s new $250 M BioGuard initiative on rapid vaccine platforms
- Personally prototyping “Focus Sprints” — asynchronous, distraction-free work windows backed by behavioral research
- Long-term interest: governance frameworks for off-planet colonies that incorporate effective-altruist ethics

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Meditation devotee (logged 1,800+ retreat hours); credits practice for “compound clarity” in decision-making
- Weekend hobby: building modular hydroponic rigs in his garage—testing low-resource food production for extreme environments
- Favorite quote: “The only viable path is the one that scales compassion faster than technology.”
- Enjoys hard science-fiction board games (Terraforming Mars, High Frontier) as social thought experiments

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar dinner aligns with his curiosity about productivity and wellbeing in micro-gravity workspaces
- Seeks firsthand data on closed-loop life-support systems and human factors of off-planet collaboration for upcoming Open Phil white paper
- Brings: experience orchestrating large-scale, mission-driven teams; potential seven-figure grant capacity for research that de-risks lunar habitation

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: 
  • NASA Artemis Human Factors group  
  • ESA’s MELiSSA circular-bioeconomy team  
  • Culinary scientists working on palatable nutrient-dense algae
- Attendees can help by sharing lived insights on extreme-environment teamwork or proposals for measurable well-being metrics in space
- Engaging style: data-rich conversation, rapid context switches; offer concrete problem statements, not vague vision pitches

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: avoids media spotlight on personal giving—keep grant talk discreet
- Unusual fact prompt: his 60-day silent retreat where he visualized writing code in breath cycles; open to discussing cognitive effects
- Follow-up Qs: level of personal risk he’s willing to assume for lunar travel; appetite for funding joint Asana-Planta experiment on ultra-low-latency collaboration across Earth-Moon lag
