### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Ken Rosewall

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Sydney’s Lower North Shore; maintains pied-à-terre in London near Queen’s Club
- Annual circuit: January in Melbourne (Aus Open commentary); May–July split between Paris & London for clay-to-grass season engagements; winters in Palm Desert for rehab-friendly climate

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Legendary eight-time Grand Slam champion; longest top-10 span in men’s tennis history (1952-1977)
- Current roles: Honorary Board Chair, Rosewall Sports & Longevity Institute; Strategic Advisor, Hawk-Eye Innovations senior-athlete division
- Key influence: Pioneer advocate for open-era player revenue sharing—consulted by ATP on legacy funds

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Spearheading a multi-centre study on low-gravity training benefits for joint preservation in aging athletes—partnering with Japan’s JAXA and University of Sydney BioMed Lab
- Finalising memoir addendum “Beyond the Baseline,” focused on resilience neuroscience and space-aided rehabilitation (Q4 2026 release)
- Personal ambition: establish a scholarship that sends under-represented junior players to cross-training programs incorporating VR and reduced-gravity modules

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Enjoys crafting French-style soufflés—claims perfect altitude makes or breaks texture; curious how lunar gravity alters rise
- Lifelong jazz-vinyl collector; keeps a portable DAC to demo 1959 live Coltrane sessions at gatherings
- Guiding maxim: “Precision outlasts power.” Sees this applicable to space engineering and human relations alike

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Only elite athlete actively researching performance in sub-lunar conditions; offers media draw and historical gravitas bridging sport and space tech
- Seeking dialogue on micro-gravity culinary chemistry (soufflé experiment) and collaboration on lunar physiotherapy prototypes
- Brings value: first-hand high-performance insights, inspirational storytelling on adapting technique across eras, willingness to film short content pieces for Planta’s post-event documentary

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to:  
  • Dr. Mei Lin (NASA Food Science) re: texture dynamics in 1/6 G  
  • Starship Health Ventures partners exploring senior mobility solutions  
  • Venture philanthropists interested in endowing the Rosewall Lunar Scholarship
- Attendees can assist by providing rapid-prototyping contacts for lightweight resistance bands usable on the Moon
- Engage him through tactile demonstrations—he responds best when he can physically test devices or ingredients

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Minor hearing reduction in left ear; stand on his right side when conversing in ambient noise
- Unusual fact prompt: He once performed classical piano accompaniment for Rod Laver at a private 1969 recital—almost pursued music professionally
- Follow-up: Secure copy of Planta’s gravity-modulated kitchen specs for pre-event soufflé calibration
