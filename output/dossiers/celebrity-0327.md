### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Suze Orman

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: A private home on Bahamian island of South Eleuthera  
- Secondary bases: San Francisco Marina condo (summer) & Midtown Manhattan pied-à-terre for media hits  
- Travel rhythm: 10–12 U.S. speaking dates/yr, quarterly trips to Washington D.C. for financial-literacy lobbying, and new bi-monthly visits to SpaceX Boca Chica to observe civilian-astronaut training programs she quietly sponsors  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & Chief Advocacy Officer, SecureSave (workplace emergency-savings platform; 4 M users)  
- Host, “Women & Money” podcast (≈2 M weekly downloads) and ongoing CNBC contributor  
- Best-selling author of 11 personal-finance books; two-time Emmy winner for “The Suze Orman Show”  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Leading SecureSave’s Series C ($75 M target) to integrate instant-pay and health-savings wallets for gig workers  
- Building “Money Moonshot” curriculum: a first-of-its-kind financial-literacy module for commercial astronauts & space tourists (launching late 2026 with three space-agency partners)  
- Personal goal: complete PADI Master Scuba Diver certification and film a mini-doc on coral-reef restoration with proceeds donated to ocean-bond financing projects  
- Exploring blockchain-backed micro-insurance for off-planet property and life-support assets  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Former Buttercup Bakery server—still bakes sourdough weekly; swears by 36-hour cold proof  
- Collects antique doorknobs; sees them as “symbols of gateways to financial freedom”  
- Daily meditation + open-water swims; credits stoic philosophy—favorite quote: “Wealth is the ability to fully experience life” (Thoreau)  
- Believes the next trillion-dollar market is “risk mitigation for multi-planetary living”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Planta’s lunar dinner provides a live case study for Money Moonshot; she’ll harvest anecdotes for Module 3: “Emotional Spending in Extraordinary Environments”  
- Wants candid dialogue on: lunar property rights, crypto-settlement layers with sub-second latency, and psychological drivers of consumption in zero-G social settings  
- Value offered: decades of simplifying complex money topics for mass audiences; ready to film a short “Lunar Ledger” segment for Planta’s content stream  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros to:  
  • Space insurance underwriters at Lloyd’s & Marsh McLennan  
  • Legal scholars drafting Artemis Accord property clauses  
  • XR/VR studios building immersive financial-education modules  
- She can mentor founders tackling inclusive fintech or emergency-savings tools for frontier workers  
- Engaging her: ask how she would design a “space prenup” or price lunar life insurance—she lights up when challenged to create practical frameworks from scratch  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Surprising icebreaker: once restored a 1967 Shelby GT500 and drag-raced it—relates engine tuning to portfolio rebalancing  
- Recent minor ankle re-injury; prefers minimal standing time during the lunar-gravity dinner  
- Off limits: any mention of past SEC tussles—she finds it tiresome  
- Follow-up intel to gather: beta results of SecureSave’s AI spending-coach; progress of Artemis-linked micro-insurance prototype
