### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Rod Laver

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Rancho Mirage, CA; maintains family property near Rockhampton, Queensland
- Routine circuit: annual presence at all four Grand Slams, Laver Cup cities, and select sports-tech conferences in San Francisco & Singapore

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Tennis icon; only athlete with two calendar-year Grand Slams (1962, 1969)
- Honorary President, Laver Cup; strategic advisor/LP to Tennis Innovation Ventures (seed-stage fund focused on performance analytics & immersive fan tech)
- Philanthropy: Rod Laver Medical Research Trust (>US $35 M disbursed to cardiac & neuro-aging studies)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Spearheading a mixed-reality training platform allowing junior players to “hit” against avatars of legendary matches—alpha launch slated Wimbledon 2026
- Executive-producing 6-part Netflix docuseries “The Original Rocket” (airing 2028, in sync with Grand Slam 60th anniversary)
- Personal quest: longevity optimization—trialing peptide therapies & micro-gravity exercise protocols to maintain bone density beyond 90
- Quietly assembling a charitable endowment to fund Indigenous Australian athletes (announcement expected Australian Open 2027)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong watch aficionado; currently captivated by space-grade titanium movements—great segue to lunar engineering talk
- Enjoys woodworking; crafts custom racquet-shaped charcuterie boards for friends
- Guiding maxim: “Pressure is a privilege—take the ball early, in life and on court.”
- Curious about how partial gravity alters topspin and joint load—willing to theorize over dinner napkins

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Draws publicity prestige and cross-generational appeal to the first social gathering off-planet
- Eager to meet engineers modeling musculoskeletal effects of 1/6 g; exploring concept of an exhibition “Moon Rally” during Artemis IV window
- Seeking partners for adaptive sports equipment using lunar-derived composites
- Can offer: storytelling gravitas, global media interest, and a compelling narrative on human potential

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Human Performance Lab, Blue Origin payload team, Longevity Vision Fund (D. Itskov); culinary scientists experimenting with nutrient-dense meals for senior astronauts
- Attendees can assist by sharing data on low-gravity biomechanics or onboarding the docuseries as co-producers
- Engagement tips: Start with an open-ended question about his 1969 wooden racquet vs. today’s carbon fiber—he’ll seamlessly pivot to future materials

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Hearing in left ear reduced—choose a seat on his right side in the pressurized dining dome
- Prefers direct, humble exchanges; bristles at excessive flattery
- Follow-up area: confirm if he’s secured lunar-module insurance coverage for the proposed Moon Rally exhibition
