### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Brooklyn, NY
- Regular circuits: Los Angeles (content studio), Amsterdam (circular-economy think tank), Nairobi (youth climate accelerator)
- Pattern: Three-month “climate sabbaticals” where she embeds with grassroots groups to keep on-the-ground perspective

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Intersectional Environmentalist (IE) – 1.2 M cross-platform community driving climate justice education
- Author, “The Intersectional Environmentalist” (global release in 21 languages; 2024 Pulitzer finalist, General Non-Fiction)
- UN Youth Climate Champion alum; consults Fortune 100 brands on inclusive sustainability narratives

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Building IE’s Web3-enabled “Regenerative Commons” platform for transparent funding of frontline climate projects (launch Q4 2025; $8 M seed closed)
- Negotiating a docu-series with Netflix on communities designing climate-positive futures
- Personal exploration: lunar and Martian closed-loop agriculture—using the hype around off-planet living to re-ignite Earth-care urgency
- 2025–26 goal: Assemble a climate-justice cap table allowing BIPOC founders faster access to hard-tech climate capital

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
