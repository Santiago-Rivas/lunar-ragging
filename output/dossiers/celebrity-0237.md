- Founder, Alcaraz Performance Lab—seed-stage fund + R&D studio backing sensor-laden apparel, cognitive-training VR modules

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Targeting career-first “Calendar Slam” in 2026; assembling multidisciplinary performance pod (sleep scientist, osteopath, cognitive coach)
- Finalizing Series A for Performance Lab; eyeing minority stakes in biomechanics wearables (Apollo Motion) and low-G resistance rigs
- Personal: learning conversational English-Chinese for Asia fan-base expansion; experimenting with plant-based recovery nutrition
- Philanthropy: building public tennis courts in under-resourced Spanish regions; pilot site opens Murcia Q1 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Moon dinner as proof-of-concept for sport in extraterrestrial settings; wants to be “the first athlete to hit a topspin forehand in lunar gravity”
- Seeking insight into low-G biomechanics research, materials that retain string tension in extreme temperature swings, and immersive-media capture for a potential docuseries “Courts Beyond Earth”
- Offers star-power narrative of human performance frontiers; willing to participate in live demonstration or Q&A streamed to Earth audiences

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Ideal intros: 
  • Dr. Christina Huang (NASA Human Performance Lab)  
  • Richard White (Virgin Galactic Sports Ventures)  
  • AR/VR storytellers from Meta Reality Labs for joint lunar rally activation
- Asks from attendees: access to physiological data on astronauts’ muscle atrophy mitigation; contact with sustainable textile innovators for zero-waste travel gear
- Engagement tips: open with chess or astronomy talk, segue to shared curiosity about how reduced gravity alters spin dynamics; keep exchanges energetic and forward-looking

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Manager Albert Molina guards schedule; last-minute commitments rare—secure time via Performance Lab angle
- Prefers informal seating over dais speeches; suggest side-conversation near observation dome to let him compare lunar surface to night sky views from Spain
- Surprising-fact prompt: his hidden talent for rapid-fire Rubik’s Cube solves (under 30 seconds)—possible ice-breaker if conversation stalls
