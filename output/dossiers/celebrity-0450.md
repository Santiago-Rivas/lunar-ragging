### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Hamdi Ulukaya

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Manhattan, NY; maintains regular presence at Chobani’s Innovation Hub in Twin Falls, ID
- Monthly transatlantic loop: New York ↔ Istanbul ↔ Athens to oversee refugee-employment initiatives and dairy supply partnerships  
- Known to tack on “field days” in rural communities—shows up unannounced at farms or food-tech labs

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Chobani; $2.4 B annual revenue from yogurt, oat milk, and cultured-protein lines  
- Principal, NUWA Capital (personal fund) backing circular-economy food technologies  
- Architect of the “Fair Trade Dairy” standard; TIME 100, UN Global Goals Advocate

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing 2026 IPO readiness while keeping majority employee-ownership intact  
- Scaling Chobani’s precision-fermentation program to replace animal rennet and reduce cold-chain loads by 40%  
- Launching Refugee Hiring Coalition 2.0—goal: 10,000 placements across EU & U.S. within 18 months  
- Personal stretch project: piloting closed-loop, algae-based whey treatment to produce edible proteins for low-gravity environments

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Plays the saz (long-necked Turkish lute) to decompress; often breaks ice by teaching a 30-second Anatolian riff  
- Loves poetry of Nazım Hikmet—quotes “To live like a tree, alone and free, and brotherly like the forest” when discussing community  
- Relishes “impossible challenges” dinners: invites scientists to cook with only what they grow on-site in 24 hours  
- Surprising fact he enjoys sharing: once worked as a truck mechanic; still carries a socket wrench in his travel bag “for luck”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Moon Dinner as a proving ground for remote food production systems and shared-table culture in hostile settings  
- Looking to swap notes on bioregenerative life-support diets, flavor retention under low pressure, and community contracts for extraterrestrial crews  
- Brings deep expertise in fermentation, brand storytelling, and values-driven workforce models—can articulate “why food tastes like home even 384,400 km away”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: NASA Food Systems Lab, ESA MELiSSA program, Patagonia Provisions sustainability team  
- Could mentor early-stage founders on consumer trust, equitable profit-sharing, and immigrant workforce integration  
- Engage him with hands-on demos (e.g., lunar-grown herbs tasting) followed by a candid question about purpose—he gravitates toward authenticity over tech showmanship

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Advisers caution him to avoid explicit IPO details—stay on product, culture, and impact angles  
- Personal trigger: corporate jargon around “human capital efficiency”; prefers “people”  
- Follow-up probe: viability results from his algae-whey trial—data expected Q4 2025; securing that insight could shape joint lunar food ventures
