### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Li Ka-shing

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Hong Kong (Deep Water Bay residence); secondary footholds in Vancouver & London
- Quarterly hops to Silicon Valley, Tel Aviv, and Singapore to review Horizon Ventures’ seed portfolio

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Senior Adviser & former Chairman, CK Hutchison Holdings and CK Asset Holdings (global ports, telecoms, infrastructure)
- Founder, Horizons Ventures – early backer of Zoom, Spotify, DeepMind, Impossible Foods
- Philanthropy: Li Ka Shing Foundation (US$33 B lifetime giving target), with heavy allocation to medical research & tech-for-good labs

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Quietly incubating a “Longevity Logistics” initiative: supply-chain solutions for off-planet habitats, from hydroponic nutrient packs to autonomous port modules
- Intensifying bet on AI-guided drug discovery; exploring joint labs with Oxford and Tsinghua
- Personal ambition: witness the 100th birthday aboard a space-faring vessel—viewed as a symbolic capstone to a career defined by connecting continents
- Succession refinement: grooming grandsons Li Victor and Li Eric to steer digital assets, while elder son Victor focuses on traditional conglomerate pillars

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Morning ritual: two hours of classical Chinese poetry recitation for cognitive training
- Collects antique nautical maps; sees historical trade routes as analogues for cislunar commerce
- Guiding maxim: “If you can see the present clearly, the future will reveal itself.”
- Enjoys low-profile dim-sum crawls in San Francisco’s Chinatown after board meetings—uses them to gauge grassroots sentiment

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevant because Planta’s lunar dinner aligns with his “Longevity Logistics” concept and extends his legacy of building gateways—this time, between Earth and Moon
- Seeking candid insight into: (1) bioregenerative food systems for low-gravity, (2) insurance frameworks for lunar commercial liabilities, (3) experiential design that sustains psychological well-being in isolated habitats
- Brings: decades of port, telecom, and retail know-how; willingness to co-lead a Series A for lunar supply-chain startups; unparalleled political capital across Asian regulators

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros desired: NASA Artemis Gateway logistics planners; ESA-backed in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) teams; venture debt providers comfortable with extraterrestrial collateral
- Attendees can assist by sharing prototypes or data on closed-loop agriculture and radiation-shielded living modules
- Engagement tips: open with a succinct metric (he memorizes numbers quickly); pivot to macro impact; end with a human story—he prizes emotional resonance behind tech

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: monitoring Hong Kong policy optics—avoid framing lunar investments as offshore asset shifts
- Unusual fact to surface per host’s goal: as a teen refugee, he hand-crafted plastic watchbands at night; still keeps one on his desk as a reminder—few outside family know it survived every office move
- Follow-up areas: confirm his appetite for long-duration lunar stay sponsorships; gauge timeline for Li Foundation’s next $500 M tech-for-good tranche
