---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Barcelona, Spain  
- Regular circuits: Madrid (national-team HQ), New York & Los Angeles (endorsements), Doha (Aspire sports-science lab)  
- Off-season retreats to Minorca; travels with a portable astro-photography rig

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Captain & attacking midfielder, FC Barcelona Femení; record-setting scorer in UEFA Women’s Champions League  
- Two-time Ballon d’Or Féminin; UEFA Player of the Year, Olympic silver (2024)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Leading Barça’s push for a historic treble in the 2025-26 season while grooming next-gen midfield talents

- Personal ambition: earn UEFA-A coaching license before the 2027 Women’s World Cup to deepen tactical literacy

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur architect: sketches modular stadium concepts; fascinated by low-gravity pitch design  
- Lifelong space buff—father gave her her first telescope at 9; keeps a running list of “constellation first-touch” drills  
- Vegan-leaning gastronomy; collects heirloom bean varieties and unusual seaweed recipes for recovery nutrition  
- Guiding mantra: “El talento solo florece con trabajo invisible” (“Talent only blooms through invisible work”)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Symbol of elite teamwork and women’s empowerment—ideal narrative fit for a pioneering lunar gathering

- Can offer global visibility, inspirational storytelling, and post-event content that reaches 30 M+ followers

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA’s Human Performance team, Adidas FutureLab (zero-G footwear prototypes), venture partners at Moonshot Capital  
- Attendees can assist by providing beta access to motion-capture wearables or committing foundation grants to girls-in-space STEM modules  
- Engage her with questions about building the first futsal court on the Moon or share an astronomy anecdote; avoid generic “great season” small talk

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Surprisingly fluent in Greek; learned during Erasmus semester—prompt about Greek poets for an off-beat icebreaker

- Follow-up: invite her to co-curate a “Zero-Gravity Skills Challenge” demo at Planta’s 2026 Earth-orbit showcase  
- Observes mindful tech use—appreciates concise, purposeful comms; send any materials as one-page briefs, not slide decks
