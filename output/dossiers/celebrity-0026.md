### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Alex Honnold

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Current base: Las Vegas, NV; maintains a tiny-home in Reno for family proximity  
- Nomadic rhythm: 9-month climbing circuits split between Patagonia, the European Alps, and remote desert big walls  
- Comfortable operating off-grid for weeks; self-sufficient travel kit always <14 kg

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Professional rock climber & expedition athlete; first person to free-solo El Capitan (2017)  
- Executive Producer & on-camera host, “Climb the Impossible” (National Geographic, renewed through 2026)  
- Founder, Honnold Foundation—funded 187 community solar projects on five continents

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling the foundation’s new Lunar Analog Solar Initiative—testing micro-grid panels at NASA Desert RATS site  
- Writing follow-up book on “adaptive risk” for extreme environments; manuscript due Q1 2026  
- Training for a 2026 unsupported traverse of the Transantarctic Mountains with partner Hazel Findlay  
- Personal aim: master conversational French by end of 2025; nightly DuoLingo streak >500 days

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Deep fascination with closed-loop life-support systems; compares big-wall bivies to orbital habitats  
- Enjoys silent meditation retreats; claims “risks feel louder when the mind is quiet” (favorite line)  
- Surprising hobby: improvisational piano—travels with foldable 88-key MIDI keyboard  
- Reads astrophysics papers for fun; cites Vera Rubin as a hero for “quietly changing everything we knew”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: embodiment of human performance in hostile environments; draws parallels between moon habitation and vertical wilderness living  
- Seeking dialogue on ultra-light power storage, habitat material recycling, and psychological resilience studies  
- Offers compelling storytelling for media coverage, plus firsthand data from solar-powered expeditions that could inform Planta’s lunar energy brief

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to:  
  • SpaceX Starshield sustainability team (lunar surface power)  
  • Dr. Sonia Chan, NASA behavioral health lead (crew cohesion research)  
  • Any VC syndicate focused on off-planet infrastructure with climate co-benefits  
- Attendees can assist by sharing prototype biomonitoring wearables for harsh-environment field trials  
- Engagement tips: ask about “the one route he backed off” or lessons from remotest climbs—opens door to philosophical depth

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers direct, jargon-free dialogue; humor disarms him quickly  
- Recently became a father—keen interest in future-of-Earth narratives for next generation  
- Sensitive: avoids discussing high-profile climbing fatalities unless he raises the topic  
- Follow-up: gauge interest in serving as campaign face for Planta’s “Power Beyond Earth” initiative post-event
