### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Daniil Medvedev

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Monte-Carlo, Monaco; secondary training hub in Dubai (indoor hard-court complex he co-owns with IMG)
- Constant global rotation aligned with ATP calendar; off-season blocks in Miami and Barcelona for heat-adaptation testing

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Currently World No. 4 on the ATP Tour; 2021 US Open champion, 2024 Australian Open finalist, 20+ ATP titles
- Co-founder, Baseline X Analytics—a wearables startup quantifying fine-motor fatigue in racquet sports (seed round closed Q4 2024 at $12 M)
- Equity partner, M8 eSports Collective; streams match strategy sessions to 500 K+ Twitch followers

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Targeting career “double-slam” by reclaiming the US Open in 2026 before age 31
- Piloting zero-gravity neuromuscular research with ESA to explore injury-free plyometrics—data feed loops directly into Baseline X product roadmap
- Building personal content studio to own IP around “cerebral tennis” coaching modules; licensing discussions underway with MasterClass for 2026 launch
- Personal ambition: transition to partial venture-capital role post-2030 with focus on tech that extends athletic prime

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Avid chess tactician (online blitz rating ≈2700) and rapid mental-model advocate—quotes Botvinnik: “Tactics flow from a superior position”
- Surprising pastime: custom-designs mechanical keyboards; codes Python scripts that scrape opponent serve patterns
- Formula 1 fanatic—maintains friendship with McLaren data engineers; parallels tire-degradation analytics with court-surface wear
- Philosophy: embraces “productive discomfort”; sees controlled chaos as the path to breakthroughs

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Enthralled by the idea of hitting a tennis ball in lunar gravity—keen to debate biomechanical implications with space scientists
- Seeking collaborators who can integrate Baseline X sensors into smart-fabric space suits for dual Earth-orbit athletic testing
- Brings strong global fan reach; willing to stream a live Q&A from the lunar base to ignite public imagination around off-world sport

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intro requests: SpaceX Starship life-support R&D lead; Nestlé Health Science head of performance nutrition
- Could offer attendees private court sessions in Monte-Carlo featuring Baseline X diagnostics
- Engaging approach: ask him to predict how chess openings change if knights could make four moves—activates his “weird-physics” passion and dovetails with event’s reimagination theme

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers precise, numbers-first dialogue; disengages when conversation stays abstract too long
- Known to switch from relaxed humor to intense focus mid-sentence—read the shift and mirror conciseness
- Follow-up probes: status of ESA zero-g pilot study; interest level in equity vs. endorsement for lunar sport tech
