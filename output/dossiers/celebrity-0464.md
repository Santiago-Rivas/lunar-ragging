### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jennifer Doudna

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Berkeley, California – office split between UC Berkeley campus and Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) headquarters.
- Regular travel loop: Boston (Vertex & Beam collabs), Geneva (WHO ethics panels), Zürich & Singapore (start-up boards), plus bi-monthly field visits to CRISPR crop trials in Kenya and Brazil.

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-inventor of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing; Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2020.
- Professor of Chemistry & Molecular and Cell Biology, UC Berkeley; Founder, IGI.
- Board seats: Altos Labs, Johnson & Johnson, and space-biotech start-up Helios Biofoundry.

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Pushing IGI’s in-vivo sickle-cell therapy through Phase III by 2026.
- Launching “LunaCrop” program—editing dwarf wheat & algae strains for low-gravity growth and closed-loop O₂/food production.
- Building a $250 M Space Biology Innovation Fund with NASA Ames and private investors; first deployment scheduled on Artemis V cargo.
- Personal ambition: write a crossover pop-science/graphic novel on genetic futures aimed at Gen Z readers (outline due Q4 2025).

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend passion: artisan cheesemaking—she edits starter cultures to tweak flavor profiles; brings small batches to select gatherings.
- Enjoys dawn rowing sessions on the Oakland Estuary; says the repetitive motion “mirrors CRISPR’s precision.”
- Guiding maxim: “If we can read and write DNA, we must also learn to edit our ethics.”
- Quiet fascination with extremophile microbes from deep-sea vents—sees parallels with lunar subsurface niches.

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: spearheading biological life-support solutions essential for permanent lunar habitats.
- Seeking: partners with robotics, additive-manufacturing, and regolith-processing expertise to integrate biofoundry modules into Sea of Tranquility base.
- Offers: breakthrough protocols for on-site biomanufacturing of vitamins, bioplastics, and high-density foods; credibility to attract regulatory buy-in.

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: ESA lunar habitat program leads; Celestia Ventures (space-food fund); architect Bjarke Ingels (Moon Village concept) for habitat-bio integration.
- Attendees can assist by sharing micro-gravity fermentation data or capacity on upcoming CubeSat bioscience payloads.
- Engagement tips: present a tangible problem (“How would you edit yeast to recycle CO₂ here?”) and invite her to riff solutions; avoid lengthy academic minutiae.

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Surprising fact she enjoys sharing: once considered a career as a jazz saxophonist and still keeps a Selmer Mark VI in her lab office.
- Allergic to shellfish; confirm menu options.
- Follow-up question: timing for public release of IGI’s lunar algae genome files—can the event secure early access for collaborative experimentation?
