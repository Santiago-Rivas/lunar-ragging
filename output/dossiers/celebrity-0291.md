**FULL NAME:** Marillyn Hewson

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Arlington, VA; maintains ranch property outside Abilene, TX for family retreats  
- Regular shuttle between Washington, D.C., Silicon Valley, and Denver aerospace corridor  
- Known for precision scheduling—rarely spends two consecutive weeks in the same city  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Executive Chairman & CEO (ret.) Lockheed Martin; steered $65 B enterprise through F-35 and Orion milestones  
- Current roles: Lead Independent Director, Chevron; Board Member, Johnson & Johnson; Senior Advisor, Blackstone Tactical Opportunities  
- Architect of multiple defense-sector public-private partnerships; five-time Fortune “Most Powerful Women” #1 ranking  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Building a $500 M blended-capital fund focused on dual-use space logistics (orbital refueling, lunar construction materials)  
- Championing STEM acceleration for military families via the newly launched Hewson Scholars Program  
- Personal 12-month goal: publish memoir “Flight Path”—first draft complete, seeking narrative-driven lunar chapter to close the book  
- Quietly scouting start-ups in quantum-secure comms and autonomous in-orbit servicing  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects first-edition biographies of pioneering women aviators; Amelia Earhart’s 1932 printing is her prized possession  
- Plays competitive duplicate bridge online under an alias—uses game theory lessons in boardroom negotiations  
- Guiding maxim: “Decisive action beats perfect information.” Prefers data-rich, succinct exchanges  
- Surprising tidbit for ice-breaker: once logged zero-gravity flight hours training with USAF test pilots “for empathy with engineers”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence signals confidence in commercial lunar infrastructure; evaluating risk frameworks for permanent habitation projects  
- Seeking candid dialogue on in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) and regulatory gaps for private lunar surface ops  
- Can contribute expertise in large-scale systems integration, supply-chain resilience, and government liaison strategy  
- Interested in tasting menu’s bio-engineered crops—scoping viability for long-duration missions  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Artemis leadership (Jim Free), SpaceX Starship ops team, and sovereign wealth funds eyeing off-planet assets  
- Organizers could facilitate closed-door roundtable on cross-border lunar security protocols—her sweet spot  
- Engage her with a concise briefing deck (<8 slides) on any lunar logistics concept, then ask for “one killer flaw” she sees—sparks energetic discussion  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Discreet but approachable; responds well to thoughtful questions about mentorship rather than generic praise  
- Sensitive area: avoids public comment on ongoing defense procurement controversies—keep conversation forward-looking  
- Follow-up query: gauge appetite to join Planta’s Advisory Council in exchange for strategic equity and a dedicated STEM scholarship on the Moon
