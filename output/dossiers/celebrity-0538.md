### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Vandana Shiva

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: New Delhi & ancestral farm in Dehradun, India  
- Predictable travel loop: Geneva (UN trade & climate forums), Nairobi (Agroecology Coalition), Northern California (Berkeley lecture residency, fall semester)  
- “No-fly month” every July to model low-carbon living; otherwise accepts long-haul itineraries if bundled with 3–4 speaking engagements

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Managing Trustee, Navdanya Research Foundation for Science, Technology & Ecology  
- Physicist-turned-eco-feminist advocate; Right Livelihood Award, Sydney Peace Prize, Earth Hall of Fame  
- Has shaped global discourse on seed sovereignty, regenerative agriculture, and corporate accountability in food systems

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling “Regeneration 2030” initiative: 100 new community seed banks across the Global South by Q4 2026  
- Drafting language for a proposed UN Treaty on Agroecology & Indigenous Knowledge (target submission: COP31, Rio de Janeiro)  
- Quiet advisory role to ISRO’s Bio-Regolith project testing heritage millets in lunar-soil simulants—keen to expand trials to other under-utilized crops  
- Personal: compiling a memoir-manifesto on quantum theory’s influence on ecological thinking; expects manuscript delivery January 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate Hindustani classical vocalist; practices alap every dawn as meditative ritual  
- Keeps a private “seed diary” cataloguing flavor notes and cultural stories of 1,200+ landraces  
- Guiding maxim: “The Earth is not inert matter; she is the living source of our becoming.”  
- Enjoys speculative fiction—recently praised “Ministry for the Future” for its policy realism

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence underscores ethical, biodiversity-driven approaches to off-world agriculture and cuisine  
- Seeking: collaborators to test climate-resilient grains in controlled lunar modules; chefs willing to co-design terroir-inspired menus that honor seed diversity  
- Brings deep expertise in closed-loop nutrient cycles, social justice framing, and storytelling that links ancestral food wisdom to frontier tech

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • Lead agronomists at NASA’s Deep-Space Food Lab  
  • Culinary R&D teams at Noma Projects and Eleven Madison Park exploring space-ready fermentation  
  • Climate-forward VC funds (e.g., Regeneration.VC) willing to back biodiverse seed IP trusts  
- Engagement tips: open with a question about flavors astronauts miss most—she’ll segue into biodiversity talk; share tactile items (moon-grown herb sprig, 3-D printed seed pod) to spark sensory curiosity  
- Offer her a brief stage moment to bless the meal with a seed-sharing ritual—memorable and brand-aligned

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid pitching GMO or patent-based solutions; triggers an immediate philosophical pushback  
- Prefers unhurried, principle-driven dialogue over cocktail-style small talk; schedule a quiet five-minute corridor walk if possible  
- Surprising fact prompt: she wrote poetry on black holes during her PhD days—rarely mentioned publicly but delights in reciting a stanza on request  
- Follow-up questions for later:  
  • Would she join Planta’s advisory council on lunar biodiversity ethics?  
  • Interest in co-authoring a white paper on “Terroir Beyond Earth” with resident chefs and botanists?
