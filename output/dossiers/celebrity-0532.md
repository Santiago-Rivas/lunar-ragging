### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Thomas Heatherwick

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: King’s Cross, London – Heatherwick Studio HQ in revamped Granary Complex  
- Regular shuttles to New York, Singapore, and San Francisco for live projects and client reviews  
- Has quietly logged multiple parabolic-flight sessions over the past year to study micro-gravity material behavior  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Creative Director, Heatherwick Studio (≈250 designers, architects, and fabricators)  
- Signature works: UK Pavilion “Seed Cathedral,” NYC’s Vessel & Little Island, Google Bay View Campus co-design  
- Regarded as the cross-disciplinary “master builder” who fuses sculpture, engineering, and social choreography  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Steering “Humanise 2.0” design manifesto—turning 2023 book into an open-source toolkit for developers and city councils  
- Prototyping low-carbon, robot-woven structural skins using basalt fiber for extreme climates (terrestrial and lunar)  
- Closing rights deal for a Netflix documentary series capturing the studio’s first extraterrestrial commission  
- Personally experimenting with soundscapes that counteract sensory deprivation in sealed habitats—collab with Brian Eno’s studio  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects rare seeds from UNESCO-listed biomes; believes “a single seed can rewrite the brief”  
- Keeps a pocket sketchbook of “joy triggers” (textures, street smells, incidental choreography) to spark design moves  
- Weekend passion: refurbishing vintage 1940s lathes—claims the smell of machine oil “resets” his creativity  
- Guiding philosophy: “If a place doesn’t make you instinctively want to linger, it has failed its only test.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Moon dinner as a living lab for his thesis on “convivial density” in isolated settings  
- Looking for collaborators in closed-loop agriculture, sonic wellness, and regolith-based 3D printing to inform upcoming “Lunar Living Module” concept for a private aerospace client  
- Will contribute rapid ideation sketches and narrative placemaking frameworks to enrich the event’s post-mission report  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • SpaceX Starship interior team (mat-compatibility tests)  
  • MIT Media Lab’s Responsive Environments group (acoustic ecology)  
  • Y Combinator–backed startup MycoForm (mycelium composites)  
- Attendees can help by sharing data on occupant psychology in confinement, and by offering beta-test slots for his basalt skin panels in analog habitats  
- Engage him with tactile demos—textured lunar regolith samples, VR haptics, or even unusual cutlery used in micro-gravity dining; he responds viscerally to material “surprise”  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive area: The Vessel’s suicide incidents—avoid unless he raises it in context of design responsibility  
- He dislikes PowerPoint; prefers impromptu whiteboard or napkin sketches  
- Follow-up probes: status of the basalt fiber pilot in Iceland, and whether the Netflix deal allows on-moon filming rights for 2027 launch
