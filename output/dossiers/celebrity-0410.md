### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects antique maps of the Indian Ocean trade routes; believes “history is a blueprint for scalable networks”  
- Serious jazz aficionado—plays tenor sax nightly to unwind; has jammed incognito in Delhi speakeasies  
- Early riser bio-hacker: intermittent fasting + Himalayan cold-water plunges, credits the regimen for 18-hour workdays  
- Enjoys turning complex policy into tweet-sized anecdotes; maintains a private notebook of future TED-style soundbites  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a live case study for “borderless commons” and digital public goods beyond Earth jurisdictions  
- Wants candid dialogue on:  
  • Governance models for off-planet resources  
  • Low-carbon propulsion financing frameworks  
  • Storytelling techniques to make space exploration relatable to rural populations  
- Brings deep emerging-economy perspective, political convening power, and access to India’s vast talent pipeline  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired:  
  • European Space Agency’s Sustainable Space Division (for lunar debris standards)  
  • Patagonia Ventures’ regeneration fund (hydrogen projects)  
  • Chef-astronaut José Andrés (to discuss culturally inclusive space cuisine)  
- Can open doors to: Indian sovereign funds, ISRO tech transfer labs, and ASEAN climate-tech regulators  
- Engage him during the event with a provocative question: “How would you embed an Aadhaar-style identity layer on the Moon without creating digital divides?”  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Unusual fact for the host’s prompt: At 17 he hitch-hiked from Kochi to Istanbul sketching ports; the hand-drawn logbook still guides his infrastructure metaphors—brings it on most trips  
- Sensitive: allergic to champagne—offer aged single-malt or tulsi tea instead  
- Follow-up probe: gauge his appetite to chair a post-event task force on “Lunar Commons & Equitable Access” for Planta Network
