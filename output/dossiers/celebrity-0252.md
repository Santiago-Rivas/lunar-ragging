### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Professional tennis player; 2021 US Open champion and first qualifier to win a Grand Slam
- Global ambassador for Dior, Porsche, HSBC, Vodafone, and British Airways
- Co-founder, Apollo Edge Labs—startup using AI wearables to map injury-risk micro-patterns in racquet sports

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Targeting second Grand Slam title before Paris 2026 Olympics; rehired coach Torben Beltz for aggressive baseline overhaul
- Leading £18 M Series A for Apollo Edge Labs; piloting sensors with Lawn Tennis Association junior academies
- Completing remote modules toward a BSc in Materials Science (Imperial College partnership program)
- Personal goal: earn a motorsport track license and compete in a charity GT4 race within 12 months

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Fluent in Mandarin and conversational Romanian; uses Chinese social media to keep a direct unfiltered fan channel
- Obsessed with mechanical engineering—strips and rebuilds a 1974 Porsche 911 in off-season
- Amateur astrophotographer; runs a portable Newtonian telescope during tournament layovers
- Guiding maxim: “Pressure is a privilege—manage variables, then enjoy the chaos”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Fascinated by low-gravity biomechanics; intends to capture high-speed motion data of a tennis serve on the lunar surface
- Seeks dialogue with space medicine researchers on bone density preservation and fast-twitch muscle adaptation
- Offers athlete perspective on integrating immersive social tech with elite performance narratives—natural testimonial fit for Planta’s “human connection beyond Earth” thesis

- Prefers tightly scoped, data-rich conversations; tunes out if the dialogue turns overly promotional
- Media fatigue after earlier spotlight; ensure privacy assurances before photo requests
- Follow-up exploration: gauge appetite for becoming athlete-in-residence on future Planta “Orbital Social Hub” concept—would align with her STEM advocacy and adventure persona
