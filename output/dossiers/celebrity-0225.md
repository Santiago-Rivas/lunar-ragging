### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Paolo Maldini

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Milan, Italy (family estate in the San Siro district)
- Secondary foothold: Miami, FL – divides time 60/40 to oversee U.S. ventures and enjoy year-round water sports
- Travel rhythm: Monthly hops to London and Riyadh for advisory boards; prefers private Gulfstream G550, but agreed to ride Planta’s shuttle “for the story”

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Cofounder & Chair, Maldini & Partners Sport Capital – €250 M fund focused on performance analytics, sustainable stadium design, and athlete-led brands
- Former Technical Director & Club Legend, AC Milan (902 first-team appearances; 26 trophies)
- FIFA “Living Legend” ambassador; executive committee member, World Leagues Sustainability Pact

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Raising a €120 M side-car fund dedicated to low-gravity and extreme-environment training tech after NASA-Parma Calcio pilot impressed investors
- Building “Casa Maldini” lifestyle label (organic athleisure + high-altitude skincare) with wife Adriana as creative lead
- Personal goal: certify as PADI Master Scuba Diver by Q4 2025; uses dives to test wearable oxygen-efficiency sensors his fund backed
- Mentoring son Daniel’s transition from Serie A journeyman to content-driven athlete-entrepreneur

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Obsessive vintner—cultivates nebbiolo vines on family hillside; experimenting with lunar-soil simulant pots to test terroir variability
- Quiet architecture buff; sketches minimalist stadium concepts during flights (“a stadium should breathe like a lung”)
- Guiding credo: “Elegance is economy of movement—on the pitch, in business, in life.”
- Reads Stoic philosophy in original Latin to decompress; Seneca quotes often pepper conversations
- Unknown quirk: collects vintage Japanese denim; can identify shuttle crew uniforms’ selvedge weight at a glance

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Sport icon showcasing how elite performance, design, and sustainability intersect with off-world habitats
- Seeking: Insight into Planta’s social-connectivity APIs to gamify remote fan engagement during zero-G friendlies
- Will offer: Case study data from UEFA/ESA “Zero-G Skills Lab” plus potential endorsement to fast-track media exposure

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to: 
  • SpaceX Starship life-support R&D team (joint performance sensor trials)  
  • LVMH Ventures’ “Beyond Earth” portfolio scouts
- Attendees can help by sharing: lessons learned from Mars-analog agriculture useful for Maldini’s nebbiolo experiment
- Engage him with: micro-gravity foot-tennis challenge or a blind tasting of hydroponic merlot—competitive spirit and palate activation guarantee enthusiasm

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Recently declined Saudi Pro League director role; avoid public mention
- Prefers concise data, then deep storytelling; schedule 10 minutes of quiet reflection post-dinner before formal asks
- Follow-up Qs: status of EU tax incentives for athlete-run sustainability funds; interest in co-hosting a zero-G charity match benefitting Mediterranean coral restoration
