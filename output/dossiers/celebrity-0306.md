- Lead investor in “Tencent Lunar Link” consortium—building edge-compute relay satellites to service cislunar traffic (quietly acquired 9% stake in ispace Japan, 2024)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Rolling out WeChat Next: mixed-reality social layer designed for zero-gravity habitats and haptic avatars
- Positioning Tencent Cloud as default backbone for Asia-Pacific space-industry data; $3 B CAPEX earmarked for low-latency lunar relays (2025-27)

- Personal: ramping philanthropic Blue Wave Initiative—restoration of South China Sea coral; aims for first fully autonomous reef-monitoring drone fleet by Q4 2025

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Avid bird-watcher; keeps a private log of rare coastal sightings—uses the discipline as a “design lesson in quiet observation”
- Collects Song-dynasty calligraphy; believes brush-stroke flow mirrors elegant code architecture
- Guiding maxim: “If the product feels invisible, we built it right.”
- Surprising fact: sketches manga-style storyboards himself for new game concepts—rarely shared beyond inner circle

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees Planta’s lunar dinner as a live stress-test for WeChat Next’s cross-gravity social framework; will silently benchmark latency and avatar fidelity during the meal
- Hunting for culinary-tech narratives to seed Tencent Video’s upcoming “Life Off-World” docu-series
- Offers: turnkey social-commerce rails for moon-based souvenirs/NFTs; financial muscle to co-fund Planta’s experiential pipeline

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: NASA Artemis communication team, Saudi NEOM’s Oxagon orbital logistics group, and Michelin-star chef Natsuko Takei (for immersive food licensing)
- Attendees can assist by sharing real-time biometric feedback dashboards—data vital for WeChat Next UX tuning
- Engaging tips: lead with future-state scenarios, not past wins; propose mutually measurable pilots; ask about coral drones or bird-migration analytics for an instant spark

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Deeply media-shy; prefers off-record conversations and small, data-rich exchanges
- Avoid direct politics; frame discussions in terms of “ecosystem benefits” and user value
- Follow-up questions to consider:
  • What post-launch KPIs will decide Tencent’s larger lunar investment?
  • Interest level in co-creating a space-food NFT merchandising layer with Planta?
