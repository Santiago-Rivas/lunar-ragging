### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jon Waterhouse

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Angeles, CA (downtown loft doubled as R&D studio)
- Secondary anchors: Cape Canaveral launch corridor & Kyoto (quarterly stays to study traditional craftsmanship)
- Routinely hops between West Coast, Florida Space Coast, and Tokyo—72-hour cycles common when prepping experiential installs

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, CelestiaX Experiential Labs—pioneer in extreme-environment hospitality and mixed-reality dining
- Creative director for SpaceX “In-Orbit Soirée” prototype; secured $42 M in sponsorships from luxury brands
- Holder of 11 design patents spanning zero-g food plating, aroma-based AR overlays, and deployable lunar surface habitats

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing a strategic partnership with Axiom Space to embed CelestiaX’s modular galley system inside the first commercial space station (pilot install slated for Q3 2027)
- Building a seed-fund portfolio (“Orbital Tastes Fund”) targeting micro-gravity agriculture startups—first close expected July 2025
- Personally learning Japanese woodworking to apply joinery principles to fold-flat lunar furniture—aiming for a proof-of-concept at the Moon dinner
- Quietly scouting a creative COO; needs operations rigor to free him for IP licensing and brand storytelling

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects antique scent diffusers; believes “memory is 80 % aroma”
- Weekend ultralight pilot; says the cockpit is his meditation space
- Guiding maxim: “Novelty is a nutrient—serve it fresh.”
- Surprising fact most don’t know: spent two seasons as a puppeteer with Jim Henson’s Creature Shop, credits that for his tactile design obsession

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to architect the multisensory flow from airlock arrival to dessert reveal; will run a live “scent-mapping” demo
- Actively seeks collaborators in lunar hydroponics and low-energy refrigeration
- Brings marquee draw for media; his presence guarantees lifestyle press coverage and high-impact visuals

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to:  
  • Marta Kárpáti (ESA food systems lead)  
  • Global Luxury Group’s CSR arm (for co-branding sustainability narrative)  
  • Any VC partners with prior space-tech and F&B crossover deals
- Attendees can help by sharing data on regolith-shielded bioreactors or by offering post-event terrestrial pop-up venues
- Best engagement tactic: ask him to “storyboard” a dish—he’ll sketch sensory layers on a napkin within seconds

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Dislikes PowerPoint; prefers tactile prototypes—bring a 3-D printed mockup over a slide deck
- Allergic to cilantro; flag catering team
- Potential follow-up: depth of his Orbital Tastes Fund—ticket size, thesis, and LP composition
