- Minority investor/advisor, RallySense (sensor-embedded racket startup) and PlayBack Health (AI-driven injury-recovery platform)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Spearheading U.S. launch of RallySense Gen-3 smart-racket ahead of 2026 season; targeting youth academies and space-sparing urban courts
- Writing follow-up to bestselling memoir “The Outsider” focusing on mindset longevity and cross-disciplinary grit
- Personally experimenting with zero-gravity training protocols after partnering with Axiom Space for a short-duration centrifuge program—aims to publish insights on balance and neuromuscular adaptation in older athletes
- Family-centric goal: create an endowed college scholarship honoring his late mother/coach Gloria Connors by 2027

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong Elvis Presley super-fan; owns a rare Sun Records acetate he travels with for good luck
- Passionate about blackjack strategy—claims card-counting sharpened his on-court anticipation
- Guiding philosophy: “Pressure is privilege—if you feel it, you’re in the right arena.”
- Enjoys tinkering with 3-D printers to prototype custom grip molds; finds parallels between racket feel and astronaut tool ergonomics

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited as a cultural bridge: legendary competitor exploring performance in extreme environments
- Seeking dialogue on how microgravity research can translate to senior wellness tech and balance therapies
- Offers decades-deep storytelling on grit, mental toughness, and fan engagement—valuable for Planta’s mission to redesign human connection off-world
- Prepared to demo RallySense metrics live if limited-g flight or VR simulation space available

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES

  • NASA Human Research Program leads studying proprioception  
  • Silver Lake Partners’ sports-tech fund for Series B syndication  
  • Michelin-star chefs exploring “nutrient-dense indulgence” menus for active seniors
- Will gladly trade high-energy fireside Q&A sessions with attendees in exchange for private lunar-habitat tour and data access to Planta’s biometric platform

- Surprising fact prompt: he’s an amateur holographer and built a full-size holographic trophy room in his Montecito garage
- Follow-up: gauge his interest in co-authoring a white paper on microgravity’s effect on reaction time for aging populations
