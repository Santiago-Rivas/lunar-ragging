### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Mary Barra

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Detroit Metropolitan Area; keeps a pied-à-terre in New York for board work and media
- Monthly swing through Seoul, San Francisco, and Austin to oversee EV, AV, and battery alliances

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chair & CEO, General Motors (since 2014); first woman to lead a major global automaker
- Steering GM’s $35 B transition to all-electric and autonomous platforms (Ultium, Cruise, BrightDrop)
- Key achievements: doubled GM’s market cap post-pandemic, secured multi-billion-dollar U.S. battery hub incentives, forged landmark raw-materials deals with Lithium Americas & Posco

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- De-risking Cruise autonomous unit after 2024 regulatory setbacks; negotiating limited-use moon-rover licensing with NASA as a high-profile proof of technology
- Scaling Ultium gigafactories; hunting solid-state battery IP to leapfrog Asian competition by 2028
- Personal 2025 objective: elevate STEM equity—launching a $200 M scholarship fund tied to community colleges in battery-belt states
- Quiet R&D push: energy-positive vehicle architecture that aligns with lunar habitat micro-grids

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Unusual fact: plays the Finnish kantele (traditional string instrument) at family gatherings—heritage nod to her father’s roots
- Weekend stress relief: competitive jigsaw tournaments; swears the puzzles sharpen systems thinking
- Guiding philosophy: “You sit at the table you build.” Values pragmatic optimism and data over hype
- Reads sci-fi classics to scout tech metaphors—recently reread “The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress” as mental prep for this event

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: GM’s Lunar Mobility Division is supplying modular wheel hubs for Planta’s surface rovers
- Seeking candid dialogue on human factors in low-gravity transport and immersive social tech that could port back to in-car UX
- Will trade insights on mass-manufacturing in extreme environments; happy to showcase sample 3D-printed titanium components at dinner

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intro requests: 
  • NASA Artemis HLS life-support leads  
  • SpaceX Starship cargo logistics manager  
  • LVMH experiential design team (she’s exploring in-vehicle luxury sensory suites)
- Attendees can assist with novel biomaterials for space-grade interiors and AI copilots that adapt to lunar comms latency
- Engagement tip: open with the kantele or puzzle angle before shifting to heavy tech—she responds well to personal bridges

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: closely tracking UAW sentiment on off-world production talk—prefers off-record when discussing lunar manufacturing
- Flags AV safety lawsuits as a conversational minefield; steer toward solutions, not controversies
- Follow-up Q worth asking: how soon will GM publish its open energy-grid API, and could Planta pilot it inside the lunar base?
