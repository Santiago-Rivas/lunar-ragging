**FULL NAME:** Mindy Kaling

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Hancock Park, Los Angeles  
- Secondary work hub: Burbank (Warner Bros. lot)  
- Regular travel circuit: New York (book imprint), London (BBC co-productions), Mumbai (family & talent scouting)  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Kaling International (script-to-screen studio with first-look at WBTV and Netflix)  
- Creator/EP: “The Sex Lives of College Girls,” “Never Have I Ever,” and upcoming animated space comedy “Aunties in Orbit”  
- Screenwriter, Legally Blonde 3; NYT bestselling author twice over  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing financing & casting for “Aunties in Orbit” — aims to premiere in 2027 to coincide with renewed public interest in lunar travel  
- Inked 2024 multi-platform deal with Audible for narrative podcasts spotlighting immigrant-family humor  
- Launching “Little Cloud,” an inclusive children’s book line (first titles roll out Q4 2025)  
- Personal goal: complete suborbital flight with Blue Origin by mid-2026 to research zero-g comedic timing and document for Hulu special  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects 19th-century botanical illustrations; uses them as color palettes for set design  
- Daily 6 a.m. runs; tracks mileage obsessively—easy ice-breaker: ask about her “run-streak” app  
- Guiding philosophy: “Specificity is universality—tell the most particular story and everyone sees themselves.”  
- Surprising hobby: keeps a private spreadsheet ranking every pâtisserie she’s visited worldwide (Paris currently tops)  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited as narrative ambassador—Planta wants her comedic framing of the lunar dinner to humanize a frontier tech moment  
- Looking to absorb sensory details (lighting, acoustics, food texture in partial gravity) for “Aunties in Orbit” writers’ room  
- Seeks contacts versed in astro-agriculture and closed-loop kitchens to ground upcoming children’s title “My Moon Garden”  
- Can contribute a post-event mini-documentary or voice-over vignette amplifying Planta’s brand to her 40 M+ socials audience  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • Dr. Sian Proctor (Inspiration4 pilot) for lived lunar-analog insights  
  • Chef José Andrés’ ThinkFoodMoon lab for culinary authenticity  
  • Epic Games’ Unreal Engine storytelling team for virtual set partnership  
- Attendees can assist by offering firsthand data on circadian rhythm management in space—she wants a joke that hinges on “jet-lag without the jet.”  
- Best engagement approach: share an unexpected, sensory detail about the lunar base; ask how she’d turn it into a cold-open gag  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Protective of her two young children—avoid pressing for family photos or names  
- Prefers conversational brevity; responds well to sharp, specific questions over broad praise  
- Follow-up Q to explore: Would she cameo on-site for a 30-sec Planta AR spot if production support is arranged?
