### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers action-oriented dialogue; will disengage if talk feels purely theoretical
- Sensitive topic: recent WCK staff casualty in Sudan—offer condolences discreetly, then pivot to future-focused collaboration
- Follow-up questions worth preparing:  
  1. What surprise sensory element (sound, aroma) could amplify a moon-based dining experience?  
  2. How can Planta and WCK co-pilot a terrestrial “Moon Dinner” series to fundraise for disaster response?
