### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Stewart Butterfield

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: Vancouver, BC & San Francisco, CA  
- Maintains pied-à-terre in Kyoto for quarterly meditation retreats and design scouting  
- Travel rhythm: two-week bursts in Asia-Pacific tech corridors, followed by 10-day “quiet sprints” on Cortes Island to prototype ideas away from broadband noise  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & former CEO, Slack (NYSE: WORK; exited 2021 via $27 B Salesforce deal)  
- Founding partner, Tiny Speck Ventures—$350 M early-stage fund backing “tools for thought” and humane computing  
- Advisor to OpenAI’s human-computer interaction council; board seat at Mozilla Foundation  
- Career hallmark: repeatedly converting internal tools (Flickr, Slack) into globally adopted platforms  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Incubating stealth startup “Parallax”—low-latency mixed-reality workspace optimized for sub-second orbital communications; seed round closes Q3 2025  
- Evangelizing ethical AI frameworks: co-drafting “Playable Cooperation” manifesto for next-gen collaboration software  
- Personal mission: channel Slack windfall into climate-positive land restoration; piloting 5,000-acre regenerative forestry project on Vancouver Island  
- Preparing first photography monograph—large-format lunar landscapes envisioned through AI style-transfer (release slated mid-2026)  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong philosophy nerd (BA, MPhil: Philosophy of Mind); quotes Wittgenstein over espresso  
- Avid backcountry snowboarder; claims carving powder is “closest sensation to vacationing on the moon—until now”  
- Vegetarian since 19; enthusiastic about cellular agriculture and mycelium-based proteins  
- Guiding belief: “Collaboration tools should disappear into the background, leaving only collective flow in the foreground.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a living laboratory for far-future collaboration under extreme latency and sensory novelty  
- Seeking conversation on: designing UI/UX for 2-second Earth-to-Moon delay; psychological cohesion in small off-world teams; sustainable food systems in closed habitats  
- Offers: firsthand playbook on converting consumer delight into enterprise ubiquity; potential angel cheque for startups emerging from the event’s hackathon track  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired:  
  • NASA Human Factors & Behavioral Performance group (Dr. Grace Douglas)  
  • SpaceX Starlink latency R&D lead for Parallax beta tests  
  • Chef-scientists working on fermented protein for long-duration missions  
- Can mentor: early founders building “ambient presence” communication layers, especially open-source aligned  
- Engagement tips: skip small talk—pose a provocative design-philosophy dilemma, preferably over matcha; invite him to test a demo, feedback guaranteed within 24 hours  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Surprise hook to meet CONVERSATION_GOALS: once funded his undergrad tuition by winning online sword-trading auctions in an early MMO—he still logs in occasionally under an alias  
- Prefers low-key seating away from cameras; thrilled by zero-gravity photo ops if he can keep copies for his book  
- Follow-up after event: send him raw latency data gathered during lunar dinner interactions—he’ll fold it into Parallax’s prototype within a week
