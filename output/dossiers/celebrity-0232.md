### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Extending career toward the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics; focusing on recovery science and low-gravity fitness research
- Scaling Djokovic Foundation’s Early Childhood Digital Academy to reach 1 M under-served learners by 2027
- Exploring minority stake in a European space-medicine institute to commercialize micro-gravity rehab tech
- Personal: deepening mindfulness practice (Vipassana retreats), cultivating first-edition book collection

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS

- Amateur illusionist—keeps a deck of cards in his pocket and practices sleight-of-hand between matches
- Favorite maxim: “Master the mind, the body follows.”
- Lifelong astronomy buff; owns a custom backyard observatory dome in Marbella
- Relaxes with Balkan folk singing; has privately recorded two tracks but never released them

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a live case study for human performance in extreme environments
- Wants to compare notes on circadian disruption and plant-based nutrition in lunar gravity
- Seeks introductions to XR storytellers who can translate moon-base footage into VR empathy experiences for his foundation’s classrooms
- Can offer global media reach (10 M+ social followers) to amplify Planta’s narrative of “shared humanity beyond borders”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Human Research Program leads, SpaceX life-support engineers, Michelin-starred plant-based chefs
- Could mentor athlete-founders in Planta’s venture portfolio on branding & mental resilience
- Engage him with a short pre-dinner breath-work session or invite him to perform a quick magic trick for guests—energizes him and breaks formality
- Prompt for the ice-breaker: ask which Hubble image hangs in his study (he’ll light up describing the Pillars of Creation)

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Vaccination stance previously sparked media swirl; steer clear unless he raises it
- Prefers alkaline water at room temperature; team will supply but confirming availability scores points
- Follow-up areas: status of space-medicine investment & whether foundation will co-produce educational VR content from lunar event
