**FULL NAME:** Janelle Monáe

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Los Angeles hills studio compound
- Maintains a creative loft in Atlanta (Wondaland HQ) and crash-pad in Brooklyn for film shoots
- “Nomadic by design” tour pattern; spends 30–40% of the year abroad, favoring Berlin, Accra, and Tokyo for sonic research

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Wondaland Arts Society – multidisciplinary label/think-tank
- Eight-time Grammy nominee; Billboard Women in Music Rising Star honoree
- Critically acclaimed actor (Moonlight, Hidden Figures, Glass Onion) and executive producer on two upcoming Afrofuturist limited series

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Composing a concept album tentatively titled “Exodus 333” exploring post-Earth diasporas; integrating binaural moon-recorded ambience
- Finalizing a $25 M inclusive-tech micro-fund backing wearable neuro-interfaces that translate emotion into sound/visual art
- Writing a graphic novel (in partnership with Dark Horse) centered on a non-binary android navigating lunar colonies
- Personal: mastering French and ASL; both tied to goal of staging a trilingual theatrical production in 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects antique automatons and first-gen Japanese synths; loves discussing mechanical music history
- Practices free-diving and fencing for mindfulness—“oxygen discipline equals creative discipline”
- Guiding ethos: “If the future isn’t liberating, it isn’t the future.”
- Surprising fact ready for the host’s prompt: has been quietly collaborating with NASA food scientists to design a zero-crumb vegan croissant for micro-gravity environments

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar setting dovetails with her Afrofuturist narrative; eager to experience and potentially record the Sea of Tranquility’s acoustic profile
- Seeking dialogue with habitat engineers about sound propagation in reduced gravity for live-performance feasibility
- Could contribute a spontaneous spoken-word piece or host a post-dinner “zero-g listening session,” adding cultural cachet to Planta’s brand

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: SpaceX passenger operations team; MIT Media Lab’s Opera of the Future group; leading venture partners in neurotech (e.g., aMoon, Lux Capital)
- Attendees with expertise in sustainable textiles could support her initiative for biodegradable performance wear suitable for off-world venues
- Best engagement tactic: offer a behind-the-scenes look at any experimental tech used during the dinner; invite her to “test-drive” it and riff on future artistic uses

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Pronouns: she/they—confirm in conversation
- Prefers organic, curiosity-driven talk over formal pitching; music references are an instant rapport boost
- Avoid small-talk about chart positions; dive into craft or speculative tech
- Follow-up areas: status of “Exodus 333” mastering timeline; interest level in curating a lunar-themed artist residency with Planta post-event
