### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Angeles, CA  
- Extended stays in London and Budapest for Dune franchise reshoots (Q3–Q4 2025)  
- Annual fashion-week circuit: Paris, Milan, New York; rarely misses Paris Couture Week  
- Known to book “immersion trips” (7–10 days) in remote nature before major shoots—off-grid, no press

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Actor, producer, and creative lead at her imprint, The UJALA Collective (film-TV-interactive)  
- Two-time Emmy winner & youngest Hollywood producer with a first-look deal at HBO  
- Global brand ambassador for Bulgari and Lancôme; advisory board, Black Girls CODE

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Executive-producing Euphoria S3 (filming starts Jan 2026) with heavier thematic focus on digital identity  
- Co-developing a hybrid VR/feature narrative “Metronome” set partly in zero-g—aiming for 2028 release  
- Quietly assembling a $40 M sustainability fund targeting regenerative textile tech; first closes late 2025  
- Personal goal: earn a private pilot license to prepare for sub-orbital flight certification before 2027 lunar dinner

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Off-camera passion: vintage Leica cameras; experiments with astrophotography on desert night shoots  
- Completed an online MIT course in aerodynamics “for fun” during 2024 strike hiatus  
- Collects 1960s Motown vinyl; will DJ under the alias “Dayz” at small invite-only sets  
- Guiding idea: “Storytelling shapes empathy more than policy” (keeps this quote on her phone lock screen)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence reinforces Planta’s thesis that culture + frontier tech accelerates societal adoption  
- Wants to explore: capturing human emotion in lunar gravity via volumetric video; integrating it into Euphoria S3 marketing  
- Seeking introductions to lunar habitat architects to validate set designs for “Metronome”  
- Brings: 190 M social followers, cross-demographic reach, keen sense for translating complex tech into pop vocabulary

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • Gwynne Shotwell (SpaceX) for Dragon media payloads  
  • Peggy Whitson for lived-experience notes on long-stay micro-g movement  
  • Jonathan Ive’s LoveFrom team for bespoke wearable sensors in zero-g fashion line  
- How attendees can help: share fail-forward stories of frontier projects; invite her to hands-on demos rather than slide decks  
- Engagement tip: ask about her surprise skill—she writes Swift apps to prototype story beats (no one outside inner circle knows)

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid mention of ongoing legal tussle between HBO and a former writer—still under gag order  
- She dislikes being treated as “influencer first”; lead with creative or technical substance  
- Follow-up intel to secure: timeline for her pilot license; status of the sustainability fund’s anchor LPs
