### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Caroline Graham Hansen

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Barcelona, Spain  
- Maintains apartment in Oslo; quick weekend hops for family and federation obligations  
- Off-season escape: four-week retreats to Lofoten Islands—midnight-sun hiking and cold-water recovery swims

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Star right-winger, FC Barcelona Femení; contract through 2027 with player-ambassador clause for global brand initiatives  
- Record holder: most Champions League assists in a single season (women’s competition)  
- Co-founder, Elevate11—startup delivering sensor-embedded compression wear for injury-prone athletes

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Captaining Norway’s rebuild ahead of UEFA Women’s EURO 2027 qualifiers; personally funding a data-analytics unit for the national team  
- Scaling Elevate11 to MLS/W-NBA pilots; closing €9 M Series A led by Nordic Alpha Ventures (Q3 2025)  
- Exploring transition plan: part-time sports-tech venture partner by 2026 while still playing top-flight football  
- Personal quest: master conversational Catalan well enough to give post-match interviews without a translator by season’s end

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Unwinds by designing 8-bit side-scroll games in Unity—says level design “quietly teaches spatial awareness I use on the pitch”  
- Amateur astrophotographer; travels with a collapsible telescope and posts lunar-surface shots on a locked alt Instagram  
- Guiding philosophy: “Flow beats force—create space, don’t fight for it.” Applies on & off the field  
- Sneaks into FC Barcelona’s kitchen after evening training to experiment with Nordic-Mediterranean fusion recipes

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited as a high-performance human pushing limits under novel conditions—parallel to living and collaborating on the Moon  
- Eager to discuss low-gravity training protocols, osteo-muscular adaptation, and how sport might look in extraterrestrial colonies  
- Looking for partnerships: biosensor firms, space-nutrition researchers, and immersive VR creators for zero-G skill acquisition  
- Can offer engaging demo of cognitive-reaction drills used by Barça—portable kit fits inside a carry-on

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros requested to:  
  • Dr. Mei Tan (NASA dietetics lab) – to co-develop lunar-ready athlete meal plans  
  • Jalil Farooq (HoloSport VR) – exploring Elevate11 x VR integration  
- Attendees can help by sharing insights on lunar circadian rhythm management and community building in confined habitats  
- Optimal engagement: open with game design or astro-photography talk; segue into performance tech—the quickest route to her curiosity switch

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: recurring stress-fracture history; avoids prolonged standing—offer seating during networking clusters  
- Surprising fact prompt (for host): she recently earned a Norwegian drone-pilot license and maps coastal erosion patterns for a citizen-science project  
- Follow-up angle: gauge her interest in serving as athletic advisor for Planta’s forthcoming Mars social-habitat prototype
