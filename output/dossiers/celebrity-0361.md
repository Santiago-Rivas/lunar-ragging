### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Margaret Mitchell

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Seattle, WA  
- Maintains apartments in Paris (Hugging Face HQ satellite) & Washington, DC (policy meetings)  
- Typical month: 2 weeks in Seattle lab, 1 week EU policy circuit, 1 week on-site audits or speaking engagements worldwide  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chief Ethics Scientist, Hugging Face — directs Responsible AI & Governance unit (45-person global team)  
- Co-creator of “Model Cards” standard; ex-co-lead of Google’s Ethical AI group  
- UNESCO AI Ethics Prize 2024; Time100 AI list; architect of open-source “Holistic Eval” benchmark now mandated by several EU ministries  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing a public toolkit for generative-AI risk sign-offs aimed at frontier-model labs  
- Leading an NSF-funded consortium to build the first multilingual bias-stress test for future space-mission AIs (launch candidate: 2026 Artemis payload)  
- Drafting book “Beyond Alignment: Designing Empathy Into Machines” for early-2026 publication  
- Personal goal: earn sub-orbital pilot license before 2027 lunar dinner to experience every flight stage firsthand  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur bio-acoustics researcher; records urban bird calls at dawn to train low-resource sound classifiers  
- Restores vintage analog synths; claims patching cables “organizes my thoughts better than meditation”  
- Guiding philosophy: “Transparency is the new oxygen—scarce in space, vital everywhere.”  
- Unusual fact (conversation goal): Performed aerial silks with a traveling circus during graduate school—still practices inversion routines to counter hours at a keyboard  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Advising Planta on ethical data capture, consent, and algorithmic personalization for lunar social platforms  
- Seeking dialogue on:  
  • Governance models for autonomous habitat systems  
  • Cross-cultural norms in micro-communities (<50 people)  
  • Sensor-driven mood adaptation in mixed-reality dining  
- Brings: Credibility with regulators, open-source community reach, and a practical framework to document lunar-generated datasets for public research use  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: Space law specialists at ESA, XR neuro-designers (e.g., Anouk Wipprecht), and any chef experimenting with AI-generated flavor pairings  
- Attendees can help by offering real-time habitat telemetry for her bias-stress toolkit and sharing UX logs for ethical review  
- Engage her with: hands-on demos (she prefers “show, then debate”), offline walks along simulated regolith paths, or a quick synth-jam using lunar EM sensor data  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Keep discussions future-focused; she deflects deep dives into her Google exit  
- Prefers facts over hype—arrive with metrics  
- Potential follow-up: invite her to co-author Planta’s post-event white paper on “Human-Centered Design Beyond Earth”
