### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jannik Sinner

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Monte Carlo; maintains training hub in Bordighera, Italy  
- Seasonal blocks in Miami & Melbourne aligned with hard-court swing  
- Skiing retreats to Sexten, South Tyrol each December—also houses a small altitude lab  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- World No. 1 men’s tennis player (ATP), 3× Grand Slam champion (2024 Wimbledon, 2025 Australian Open, 2025 US Open)  
- Founder, Sinner Sports Group—early-stage investments in wearables, recovery tech, and esports teams  
- Global ambassador for Lavazza & TAG Heuer; recently signed partnership with Axiom Space on human-performance research  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Pursuing career Grand Slam; eyeing Roland-Garros 2026 to complete the set  
- Scaling Sinner Performance Labs: studying muscle retention and reaction speed in reduced-gravity environments, with ESA collaboration  
- Building “Peaks for Potential” foundation to fund mountain-region youth sport programs across Europe  
- Personal ambition: learn conversational Mandarin before Beijing Winter Games 2029 to expand Asian market presence  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong alpine skier; still logs pre-dawn runs for balance training  
- Amateur astrophotographer—travels with a collapsible 80 mm refractor to tournaments; captures night skies for mindfulness  
- Obsessed with single-origin espresso roasting; carries a portable lever machine on tour  
- Guiding maxim: “Repetition creates instinct, instinct creates freedom.”  
- Reads Stoic philosophy (favors Seneca); practices 10-minute cold-water plunge after every match  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a case study in extreme-environment physiology and social dynamics—perfect overlap with his lunar-gravity training research  
- Looking to meet: chefs experimenting with nutrient-dense, low-water cuisine; chronobiologists studying circadian shifts off-Earth  
- Can provide high-visibility athlete narrative to amplify Planta’s lunar social-tech vision; willing to film a micro-documentary segment on site  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to:  
  • SpaceX Life Sciences & Habitation team  
  • Red Bull High-Performance Lab (micro-gravity simulation unit)  
  • Patagonia CSR leads for mountain youth initiative co-sponsorship  
- Attendees can help by sharing data on sleep architecture in partial gravity and beta-testing Sinner’s sensor-embedded compression gear  
- Engage him with: espresso tasting bar, VR-tennis moon-court challenge, or a quick exchange on Dolomite ski routes  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers quiet authenticity—avoid generic “big fan” remarks; ask about his latest telescope setup instead  
- Low threshold for idle small talk; responds to specific technical questions or well-framed philosophical prompts  
- Sensitive: keeps relationship life strictly private—steer clear  
- Follow-up probe: timeline and required partners for Dolomites altitude-lab expansion slated for Q4 2026
