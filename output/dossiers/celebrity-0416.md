### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Aryan Mishra

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Bengaluru, India
- Splits time between Bengaluru, Mountain View (NASA Ames collaboration desk), and remote field sites in Ladakh for high-altitude telescope testing
- Known for “pop-up observatory” tours across rural India; averages 180 travel days/year

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & CEO, SkyBridge Labs – building lightweight, modular lunar-orbit CubeSats for real-time Earth-Moon optical relays
- Former asteroid hunter; officially credited with discovering ​K14112 & ​K12874 while still in high school
- United Nations “Space4Youth” laureate; recurring advisor to ISRO’s Young Innovators Council

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a $45 M Series A led by two sovereign wealth funds to scale SkyBridge’s optical relay network ahead of Artemis IV
- Negotiating a joint payload agreement with Intuitive Machines to flight-test a mini transceiver on IM-4 (Q4 2026)
- Personally authoring a children’s book—“Stargazing from the Craters”—to broaden STEM access in Hindi and Tamil markets
- Training for ESA’s Commercial Astronaut User pathway; logged 120 hours in parabolic flights and hyperbaric chambers since Jan 2025

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Plays classical tabla; believes rhythm practice sharpens telemetry timing skills
- Collects meteorite micromounts; carries a 4-gram Chelyabinsk fragment as a pocket “focus stone”
- Guiding philosophy: “Space is not the final frontier—mindset is.” Cites Carl Sagan’s “somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known”
- Unusual fact most miss: completed a silent, 10-day Vipassana retreat in 2024 between launch campaigns—claims it fixed his post-mission insomnia

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: SkyBridge’s real-time relay tech underpins high-bandwidth holographic dining experiences—direct fit for Planta’s Moon party communications layer
- Actively seeking early adoption partners to trial low-latency Moon-to-Earth social streaming during the 2027 dinner
- Happy to contribute a “live-sky tour” for guests using portable optics on the lunar surface, spotlighting Earth-rise, Tycho, and Jupiter at opposition

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: Planta Network’s XR engineering lead; Deep Space Network scheduling heads; luxury hospitality brands eyeing “astro-tourism”
- Attendees can assist by beta-testing SkyBridge’s AR night-sky guide or co-designing immersive culinary-astronomy storylines
- Engagement tip: ask about his taboo-breaking decision to skip university for a self-designed “space apprenticeship” road map—he lights up sharing lessons learned

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid clichés about “kid astronomer” days—he wants to be seen as a systems entrepreneur now
- Sensitive angle: recent friction with a major ISRO director over open-sourcing payload specs—steer clear unless he brings it up
- Follow-up exploration: gauge his appetite for co-branding the children’s book with Planta’s educational arm; potential cross-promo opportunity
