### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Sir Elton Hercules John

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: Windsor, UK (Old Windsor estate) & Beverly Hills, CA  
- Regular circuits: New York–London–Los Angeles for studio sessions, philanthropic galas, and Foundation board meetings  
- Post-tour travel lighter, but keeps a dedicated Gulfstream on standby for one-night charity engagements  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Chairman, Rocket Entertainment Group; manages catalog, IP licensing, and emerging-tech performances  
- Co-founder, Elton John AIDS Foundation (EJAF); over $600 M raised to date  
- Career milestones: 5 Grammys, 2 Oscars, 1 Tony, RIAA Diamond album holder, Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee, UK knighthood  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Building a “metaverse residency” with Epic Games to stream mixed-reality concerts in 2026–27  
- Negotiating a definitive biopic series (6 × 45 min) focusing on sobriety and fatherhood, targeting Apple TV+  
- Expanding EJAF’s new Lunar Health Initiative—seed grants for space-medicine research on HIV antiretrovirals in microgravity  
- Personal: devoting fringe calendar slots to his sons’ school holidays; curating a private exhibit of 1970s NASA Hasselblad photography for 2028 auction  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong Watford FC devotee; still attends matches incognito when itinerary allows  
- Obsessed with antique toy trains—has a custom layout replicating the entire Yellow Brick Road tour route  
- Style mantra: “Spectacle is kindness wrapped in rhinestones”  
- Collects Vonnegut first editions; quotes KV’s “We are what we pretend to be” when mentoring young artists  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Cultural linchpin: “Rocket Man” symbolism aligns perfectly with a lunar gathering; guests expect at least a piano-bar rendition  
- Looking to gauge feasibility of a 15-minute real-time Earth-to-Moon holographic duet for World AIDS Day 2027 broadcast  
- Hopes to swap notes with space-chefs on low-gravity flavor perception—curious if palate changes mirror chemotherapy taste shifts (link to EJAF patient studies)  
- Brings gravity-tested Yamaha-CFX keybed prototype; willing to leave one on the base as a goodwill artifact  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros requested:  
  • Planta’s XR engineering lead (for hologram latency specs)  
  • JAXA life-sciences director working on microgravity pharmacokinetics  
  • Michelin-starred chef Anaïs Roux (known for synesthesia-driven menus)  
- Offer to donate a bespoke charity concert NFT; needs blockchain compliance guidance for lunar jurisdiction  
- Best engagement tactic: ask about his sons’ budding coding projects—he lights up when discussing their Roblox mods  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Alcohol-free event preference; ensure mocktail options branded subtly “Yellow Brick Spritz”  
- Avoid probing questions about prior management disputes—still under NDA  
- Follow-up: confirm if Planta can provide a silent-press rehearsal slot (30 min) to test acoustic dampening in the Sea of Tranquility habitat
