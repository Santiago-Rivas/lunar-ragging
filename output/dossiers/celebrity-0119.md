### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Sandra Bullock

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Beverly Hills, CA; secondary residence near Austin, TX (close to extended family)  
- Travels quarterly to New York and London for production meetings; 2026 travel cadence includes test-flights with Space Perspective for high-altitude acclimation

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Academy Award–winning actor, producer, and principal of Fortis Films
- 30+ years box-office leadership ($5 B global gross); early adopter of streaming originals (Bird Box, 2018)
- Co-investor, Halo Neuroscience (wearable EEG); board adviser, Omaze charitable platform

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Packaging a limited-series adaptation of “Project Hail Mary” with Amazon MGM; keen to secure real micro-gravity shoot days
- Developing Fortis-branded non-fiction slate—short-form docuseries spotlighting women advancing off-world tech
- Personally focused on raising two teens; seeks work that allows 4-week blocks free from set obligations
- Exploring impact investing in lunar-resource recycling startups (cites “trash in orbit is trash in mind” mantra)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Avid metal-craft hobbyist; maintains a home forge—recently built a Damascus-steel chef’s knife destined for lunar use
- Collects vintage radio dramas; believes “sound tells the story your eyes miss”—often uses audio-first rehearsals
- Morning routine anchored by freediving breath-work; claims it’s the only exercise that quiets her “runaway producer brain”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Gravity (2013) cemented her public association with space; attendance signals cultural continuity from fiction to reality
- Seeking candid insight on human factors of long-duration lunar stays for upcoming docuseries
- Brings instinctive storyteller’s lens—happy to co-host a live-stream segment translating technical demos into relatable narratives

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: NASA Artemis outreach lead, SpaceX Inspiration4 alums, immersive-audio startup Spatial Inc.
- Could amplify event content to 32 M social followers—willing if messaging pairs tech with philanthropic impact
- Engage her with hands-on elements: invite to prep a course in the low-grav kitchen or record binaural “lunar soundscape” samples

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers spontaneity over scripted talking points; start with an unexpected fact (e.g., ask about her knife forging)
- Avoid prolonged discussion of celebrity gossip or past relationships—shifts focus to craft or philanthropy rapidly
- Follow-up Q: gauge her appetite to serve as on-camera host for Planta’s post-mission micro-doc series
