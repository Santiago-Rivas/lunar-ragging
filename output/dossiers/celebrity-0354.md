### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Geoffrey Hinton

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Toronto, Canada (home & Vector Institute office)
- Secondary base: London, UK (family ties; King’s College London collaboration space)
- Travel pattern: Monthly shuttles between Toronto–London; quarterly circuits to Washington DC and Bay Area for AI-policy briefings; recently added Tokyo & Abu Dhabi to explore neuromorphic chip fabs

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Independent AI researcher; Emeritus Professor, University of Toronto
- Chief Scientific Advisor & co-founder, Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence
- 2018 Turing Award laureate; co-inventor of backpropagation and foundational deep-learning architectures
- Adviser to UK Frontier AI Taskforce and UN High-Level Panel on AI Risk

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Advancing the “forward-forward” training algorithm as a biologically plausible alternative to backprop
- Incubating a stealth startup building ultra-low-power, spiking neural hardware for off-grid environments
- Drafting an international treaty framework on AI “dangerous capabilities” with former diplomats
- Personal goal: dedicate 20% of his time to mentoring researchers from the Global South on ethical AI deployment

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Wilderness canoeist; each August spends a silent week solo-paddling Algonquin Park to reset cognitive bandwidth
- Fascinated by mechanical puzzles—keeps a 3D-printed lunar-lander burr puzzle on his desk
- Core belief: “Intelligence is the compression of future possibilities into present action.”
- Surprising fact: once moonlighted as a stage-magic consultant during grad school—still practices coin illusions

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a live testbed for autonomous systems operating under extreme latency and scarce energy—ideal for his spiking-chip project
- Eager to discuss human–AI co-habitation ethics in extraterrestrial colonies; looking for cross-disciplinary perspectives (space architects, closed-loop ecologists)
- Can offer a concise lightning talk on “Prediction Machines on the Moon: Designing Curiosity-Driven Agents for Off-Earth Robotics”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: SpaceX Starship lunar ops team, Axiom Space habitat designers, Breakthrough Energy Ventures’ hardware partners
- Potential collaborator matchmaking: chefs experimenting with AI-optimized nutrition for reduced-gravity physiology
- Best engagement tactic: present a concrete technical or governance problem, then invite him to “break it” intellectually; he thrives on constructive critique

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers one-on-one or small-group dialogue; large cocktail chatter drains him quickly
- Slight high-frequency hearing loss—quiet surroundings help
- Avoid hype around “sentient” AI; he reacts better to measured, evidence-backed claims
- Follow-up questions: results of his recent forward-forward scaling experiments; status of the neuromorphic chip fabrication MoU with Mitsubishi Electric
