### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Matt Damon

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Brooklyn Heights townhouse overlooking East River
- Secondary base: Pacific Palisades home used during West Coast shoots
- Travel rhythm: Alternates 6-week production blocks with extended family breaks; frequent Boston–L.A.–London loop for Artists Equity projects

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & Producer, Artists Equity (with Ben Affleck); slate now includes scripted series, docs, and interactive VR pieces
- Academy Award–winning actor; global box office north of $10 B
- Co-founder & active board member, Water.org and WaterEquity; spearheaded $600 M micro-finance portfolio for clean-water access

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Pre-production on “Frontier”, a 10-part limited series dramatizing the first permanent lunar settlement (filming 2026; wants authentic lunar footage)
- Expanding Artists Equity’s immersive wing—partnering with Meta Reality Labs to develop 360º narrative capture tech for space environments
- Fundraising push: $150 M blended-finance vehicle linking space-derived water-recycling tech to terrestrial drought zones
- Personal focus: carving more time for four daughters; experimenting with “family-on-set” model to minimize time away during shoots

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate poker player; runs discreet monthly game benefiting Water.org—good ice-breaker
- Obsessed with fermentation; keeps a digital log of every sourdough loaf since 2019
- Guiding outlook: “Story is the most efficient delivery mechanism for empathy”—expects every project to have tangible social impact
- Surprisingly handy carpenter—built the bunk beds in his kids’ rooms during pandemic hiatus

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Iconic “astronaut” persona from The Martian; leveraging that cultural cachet to spark public imagination around lunar living
- Seeks firsthand lunar visuals and acoustic data for “Frontier”; open to shooting B-roll or behind-the-scenes segments during the dinner
- Curious about Planta’s social-connectivity platform as a narrative layer in his VR storytelling
- Can contribute celebrity amplification, media draw, and a well-honed ability to translate complex tech into emotionally resonant narratives

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: 
  • Intuitive Machines & Astrolab mission planners (lunar logistics)  
  • Culinary chemists focused on closed-loop nutrition systems  
  • Impact investors blending space tech with climate resilience
- Offer to host a short Water.org spotlight within event programming; would appreciate data on lunar water-reclamation prototypes
- Best engagement tactic: ask what surprised him most when wearing a real EVA suit at JPL—triggers animated storytelling and authentic curiosity

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid crypto jokes referencing his 2021 ad campaign—topic is tiresome
- Prefers informal, first-name basis; keeps entourage minimal (one publicist, one producer)
- Follow-up question: gauge his willingness to serve as on-camera moderator for a post-event micro-doc capturing attendees’ moon-shot visions
