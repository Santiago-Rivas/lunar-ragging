**FULL NAME:** Idris Elba  

---  
### IDENTITY & BASE

- Secondary hub: Los Angeles for filming & music collaborations  
- Regular circuits: Dubai (film finance), Accra (education charity), Nürburgring (racing weekends)  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW  
- Actor-producer (Green Door Pictures) and musician/DJ (“DJ Big Driis,” 7Wallace label)  
- Recent highlights: Executive-produced and starred in AppleTV+ thriller “Sahara,” 2024 Golden Globe win; voice of Knuckles franchise spin-off through 2026  
- Expanding into experiential media: co-founder, Gravity SoundScapes – immersive spatial-audio tech for VR/zero-G environments  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES  
- Finalizing directing slate: sci-fi feature “Orbiters” (shoots Q4 2025, aims Cannes 2027 premiere)  
- Building 7Wallace XR division to release mixed-reality DJ sets synchronized with satellite light shows  
- Personal goal: earn FIA International C racing license; prepping electric hypercar entry for 2026 GT-e Cup  
- Deepening philanthropy: STEAM labs in Ghana & Sierra Leone integrating space sciences into curricula  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS  
- Lifelong obsession with space radio transmissions—collects vintage NASA communications on vinyl  
- Keeps saxophone on every set; believes “rhythm is the language of intuition” (favorite mantra)  
- Practices Muay Thai dawn sessions for focus; proud of 2016 pro-kickboxing win—still surprises new acquaintances  
- Film philosophy: “Afrofuturism isn’t a genre, it’s a reality we’re overdue to build.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION  
- Sees the lunar dinner as a live testbed for Gravity SoundScapes’ zero-G acoustics (wants to DJ a 20-min set)  
- Curious about Planta’s social-graph API for integrating real-time emotional telemetry into immersive storytelling  
- Hunting collaborators to co-produce a docu-series on “First-generation lunar cuisine & culture”  
- Brings star power + cross-industry cred to amplify the event’s media footprint and attract creative capital  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES  
- Warm intros desired:  
  • ESA’s Human Experience Lab (sensory research)  
  • Morgan Stanley Space Fund (Series A for Gravity SoundScapes)  
  • Chef Natsuko Murakami (fermentation in microgravity)  
- Offers mentorship to young filmmakers attending; open to cameo roles in attendee projects that align with inclusive futurism  
- Engage him through music—ask about the crate of “Space Funk” acetates he intends to spin during lunar sunset  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES  
- Prefers candid one-on-one exchanges; keeps public guard but relaxes when conversation shifts to vinyl or classic rally cars  
- Avoid discussing tabloid coverage of past club incidents; deemed “boring noise” to him  
- Follow-up after event: secure rough cut access to “Orbiters” for possible Planta/Gravity cross-promo inside VR social rooms
