### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** FKA Twigs (Tahliah Debrett Barnett)

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Hackney, London; maintains studio loft in Downtown LA for writing camps
- Regular circuits: Tokyo (motion-capture labs), Reykjavík (choral recording), and Barcelona (contemporary dance residencies)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Multidisciplinary artist: singer-songwriter, choreographer, filmmaker, creative director
- Founder, AVANT/GARDE Productions – boutique studio fusing volumetric capture, sound design, and martial-arts-informed movement
- Career highlights: Mercury Prize nominee; 2× Brit Award winner; Nike “Do You Believe in More?” campaign director; scored and starred in the BAFTA-nominated short “We Are NYE”

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing third studio album “Radical Light” (Q3 2026) – blends choral polyphony with AI-generated harpsichord
- Co-developing “Gravity-Well,” an immersive VR opera with Serpentine Galleries; targets Venice Biennale 2027
- Training in aerial silks & Wushu sword forms adapted for micro-gravity performance; consulting ESA biomechanics team
- Personal ambition: launch a scholarship fund for under-represented young creatives in spatial computing

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Practices Angelo Tai chi at dawn; believes breath patterns can be “recorded” as MIDI to score movement
- Collects meteorite fragments and vintage Simmons drum pads; sees both as “rhythms captured in stone”
- Guiding maxim: “If the body can’t dream it, the mind hasn’t gone far enough.”
- Unusual fact she enjoys revealing: spent a year secretly studying fragrance chemistry—designs her own stage-scent motifs

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the lunar setting to explore how low gravity unlocks new kinesthetic vocabularies
- Seeking: 
  • Acousticians researching sound propagation in low-pressure environments  
  • Smart-textile partners for radiation-shielded, LED-embedded performance wear  
  • Angel backers for a pop-up motion-capture dome on the Moon during Artemis IV window
- Brings: global media pull, capacity to stage a mesmerizing zero-g performance, and narrative content that packages Planta’s vision for a mainstream audience

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value introductions: SpaceX Dragon Life-Support lead (for safety choreography), Unreal Engine Spatial Audio PM, Adidas FutureLab smart-fabric team, A24’s Moon-Films slate producers
- How attendees can help: share empirical data on lunar acoustics, recommend micro-g camera rigs, brainstorm cross-disciplinary residencies
- Engagement tips: ask about scent-based storytelling or her meteorite collection; propose a quick sensory experiment—capturing heartbeat data on the lunar surface for a spontaneous soundscape

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Steers clear of personal-life headlines; focus on artistic process and embodied tech
- Prefers intimate, idea-forward dialogue over group photo-ops
- Follow-ups: send Planta’s spatial-audio schematics; float idea of co-creating the event’s theme melody; invite her to curate post-dinner “dream state” VR lounge
