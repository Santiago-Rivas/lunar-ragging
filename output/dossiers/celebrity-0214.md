### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Samuel Eto’o

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: Yaoundé (FECAFOOT HQ) & Barcelona family residence  
- Satellite hubs: Doha (Aspire Zone projects) and Paris (UEFA & brand deals)  
- Known for rapid, 48-hour “touch-and-go” travel loops across Africa and Europe to inspect academy sites, then back to Cameroon for federation duties

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing a $50 M “Pitch2Planet” impact fund to wire African grassroots academies with AR/VR training rigs and satellite internet  
- Negotiating 2027 AFCON hosting guarantees around sustainability standards (solar-powered arenas, water-recovery turf)  
- Quietly researching microgravity biomechanics to launch a “Space Soccer Skills” content series—eyeing 2028 Olympic entertainment slots  
- Personal ambition: earn an executive certificate in Astrophysics & Leadership at MIT x AFRICA program (summer 2026)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Childhood fascination with astronomy; owns a 1970s Celestron telescope once used on Mount Cameroon volcanic observatory  
- Enjoys high-altitude mountaineering; summited Kilimanjaro in 2023 to raise malaria-net funds  
- Guiding maxim: “Speed without vision is just motion” – frequently repeats it to youth squads  
- Keeps a private sketchbook of stadium concepts designed for low-gravity environments; finds drawing “more meditative than football ever was”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Iconic athlete exploring the future of sport beyond Earth; embodies cross-cultural inspiration Planta wants on-site  
- Seeks dialogue on:  
  • Incorporating haptic tech to broadcast lunar events back to African classrooms  
  • Leveraging fan tokens & blockchain to finance Afro-space STEM scholarships  
- Value offered: Global brand magnetism, 16 M+ social followers, and media fluency in six languages—ideal for amplifying event impact

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to: SpaceX Starship commercial ops team, Nike’s MoonLab R&D unit, and Africa-focused climate VC “Nile Ventures”  
- Attendees can help by sharing case studies on closed-loop agriculture and mental-health protocols for long-duration missions (insights relevant to athlete camps)  
- Engaging him: open with a question about his hand-drawn low-G stadium sketches or ask how running drills change in one-sixth gravity

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Local political friction around FECAFOOT audits—avoid Cameroon federation finances in casual talk  
- Prefers concise, facts-first conversation; appreciates when counterparts speak some French or Spanish  
- Follow-up queries worth posing post-event: status of MIT astrophysics enrollment and timeline for “Space Soccer Skills” pilot shoot
