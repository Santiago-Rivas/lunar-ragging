### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Owns 270 vintage typewriters; travels with one and enjoys composing “one-page stories” for new acquaintances  
- Amateur NASA archivist; can recite radio loops from every Apollo mission—loves trading trivia  
- Weekend motorhome road trips in the American Southwest; collects Route 66 diner menus  
- Guiding maxim: “Show up early, tell the truth, leave the place better than you found it.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Iconic cultural bridge between lunar history and public imagination; perfect narrative voice for Planta’s milestone dinner  
- Actively seeking XR engineers, culinary designers, and sociologists to advise “Helios” on authentic lunar living details  
- Prepared to offer on-camera sound bites or a live reading that could amplify Planta’s media reach  
- Curious about Planta’s haptic networking prototypes—wants to test whether “distance empathy” can be improved for long-duration missions  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros to:  
  • NASA Artemis outreach director Vanessa Wyche  
  • Epic Games Unreal Engine team for volumetric capture  
  • Philanthropists with education lean (Gates, Emerson Collective) willing to co-fund space-literacy grants  
- Ideal conversation openers: ask him to draft a 100-word lunar story on your tablet; swap favorite roadside diners; debate the best mission patch design ever  
- Invite him to record a short VO snippet in the habitat—he’ll oblige if the script is tight and the mic is ready  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive to excessive fan selfies; prefers controlled photo ops. Signal ahead that the gathering is “phone-down” to keep him relaxed.  
- Health: surgically replaced knee (2024); appreciates chairs with slight recline after prolonged standing in reduced gravity suits.  
- Follow-up probe: gauge interest in becoming Planta’s storytelling advisor post-event—he enjoys titles like “Narrative Steward” more than formal board seats.
