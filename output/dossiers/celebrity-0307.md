### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Lei Jun

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Beijing (Xiaomi Science & Technology Park, Haidian)
- Maintains residences in Hong Kong and Singapore; shuttles monthly between Beijing–Shenzhen R&D corridors and Berlin for EU regulatory talks

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder, Chairman & CEO, Xiaomi Group (HKEX: 1810; 2024 revenue ≈ US $58 B)
- Steering Committee Chair, Xiaomi EV & Robotics Division (flagship SU7 e-sedan + CyberOne humanoid)
- Angel portfolio: ~70 early-stage bets (smart manufacturing, sustainable materials, precision agriculture)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing final homologation for SU7 rollout across EU by Q2 2026; eager to secure Dyson-style cross-licensing on solid-state batteries
- Scaling HyperOS as an “on-device edge cloud” for extreme environments—lunar habitat is prime proof-point
- 2025–2027 philanthropic pledge: US $500 M toward rural Chinese STEM academies; evaluating AR/VR curricula partners
- Personal aim: publish a Chinese-language business memoir emphasizing customer obsession and frugality principles

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong collector of Ming-era inkstones; finds parallels between artisanal craftsmanship and iterative hardware design
- Weeknight stress release: cooks fiery Hunan-style dishes for Xiaomi’s late-shift engineers (“chili clears the mind”)
- Adopts “Always believe something wonderful is about to happen”—puts the mantra on internal dashboards
- Enjoys endurance cycling; tracks VO₂ max data with unreleased Xiaomi wearable prototypes

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Xiaomi’s low-power IoT mesh and astro-radiation–hardened sensors could undergird Planta’s lunar social tech
- Seeking candid feedback on HyperOS UX in 1/6 g gravity and interest in co-branding “Moon Edition” devices
- Curious about psychological impacts of off-Earth dining rituals; sees opportunity for Xiaomi Health AI to study circadian metrics
- Offers: turnkey smart-habitat hardware, robots for food delivery in low-gravity, and a 100-million-user community for beta insights

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: SpaceX Starlink Enterprise, ESA’s Moon Village architecture team, and luxury chef-entrepreneur José Andrés (for Hunan-lunar fusion menu concept)
- Attendees can assist by sharing data on lunar dust mitigation for consumer electronics and viable import/export pathways for China-EU moon missions
- Best engagement tactic: ask about the “one feature HyperOS still lacks”—prompts energetic white-board sketching

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: monitors Western press for “CCP influence” narratives—avoid geopolitical jokes; frame Xiaomi as open-innovation partner
- Prefers in-depth product talk over small talk; bring a tangible prototype or sketch pad to capture his attention
- Follow-up Q: would he host a Xiaomi Community livestream from the lunar base, and what social metrics would define success?
