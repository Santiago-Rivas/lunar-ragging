### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Sara Bareilles

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: Brooklyn Heights, NY & West Hollywood, LA  
- Regular shuttle: NYC↔London (West End productions) and LA↔Nashville (recording sessions)  
- “Creative retreat” pattern: disappears to Big Sur for 4-day writing sprints—phone off, sunrise hikes, no Wi-Fi

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Multi-platinum singer-songwriter; 8× Grammy-nominated, 3× Grammy-winning (“Love Song,” “Brave,” “Amidst the Chaos”)
- Composer–lyricist & original star of Broadway/West End smash WAITRESS; Emmy-nominated for “Live in Concert” special
- Executive Producer, Little Scratch Productions—develops stage-screen hybrids emphasizing female-led narratives

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Writing & starring in “The Singularity,” a concept album–to–immersive show exploring humanity’s first off-world colony (demo tracks finished March 2025; seeking XR partners)
- Scoring a limited-series TV adaptation of “The Night Circus” (pilot delivery Q4 2025, Amazon Studios)
- Personal goal: earn suborbital flight certification by mid-2026—training at Virgin Galactic’s Spaceport America
- Advocacy: doubling down on reproductive-rights fundraising tour, proceeds earmarked for mobile health clinics in swing-state rural counties

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Avid bread-baker; travels with a 15-year-old sourdough starter (“Audrey 2”)—claims micro-gravity crumb structure fascinates her  
- Keeps a well-thumbed Rilke poetry volume in carry-on; quotes: “Let everything happen to you…” as creative mantra  
- Secret hobby: Modular synth patching—loves pairing analog bleeps with her classically trained vocals  
- Guiding view: “Music is architecture for emotion; give people somewhere new to live.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Perfect cultural bridge: can craft an improvised “lunar anthem” during the dinner’s zero-G dessert course  
- Wants to test how vocal resonance behaves in reduced gravity—seeking an engineer to rig a quick acoustic experiment in the habitat  
- Curious about Planta’s haptic social-network tech for possible integration into her immersive stage show  
- Offers cachet: high-profile social media storytelling; willing to host a behind-the-scenes podcast episode from the Sea of Tranquility

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired:  
  • Oculus/Meta Reality Labs music vertical (XR show)  
  • NASA’s Office of Technology & Innovation (sound propagation data)  
  • Chef-astronaut José Andrés for co-authoring a “Space & Spice” cookbook
- Attendee assist: access to micro-gravity audio capture gear; small group brainstorm on multisensory concert experiences  
- Engagement tip: open with unusual fermentation stories—she’ll light up; segue into speculative physics of sound

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers intimate, authentic dialogue over red-carpet chatter; will retreat if conversation turns overtly commercial  
- Possible surprise angle for “What’s something unusual…?”—she flew under a pseudonym as college a-capella beatboxer and can still drop flawless vocal percussion  
- Follow-up: ask how Spaceport training is affecting diaphragm control; she’s tracking biometrics and loves sharing data
