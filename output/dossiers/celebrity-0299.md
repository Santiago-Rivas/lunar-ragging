### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Anne Wojcicki

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primarily based in Los Altos, CA; maintains an apartment in Manhattan for investor and policy meetings  
- Regular circuits: Washington, DC (FDA, HHS), Basel (Roche partnership), and Davos; now adding quarterly visits to Houston/Starbase for space-health collaborations  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & CEO, 23andMe (NASDAQ: ME); steering transition from consumer genomics to full-stack precision-medicine company  
- Board observer, CZI’s Biohub; angel portfolio spans 40+ female-founded health-tech startups  
- Landmark achievements: 15 M+ genotyped customers, first FDA-cleared direct-to-consumer BRCA test, and a $2.8 B therapeutics JV with GSK  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Fast-tracking 23andMe’s in-house drug discovery platform—first IND filing (immune-oncology) slated for Q2 2026  
- Building a “predict-prevent” wellness subscription embedding genetic, microbiome, and real-time biomarker data  
- Personal moonshot: establish an open-access global database on radiation-induced DNA damage to support off-Earth habitation; initial discussions with NASA’s GeneLab and ESA  
- Championing federal Right-to-Genome legislation to secure individual data ownership by 2028  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Obsessed with endurance sports; completed seven 100-mile ultramarathons—claims long runs are her “R&D lab for grit”  
- Vegan-leaning foodie who tracks glycemic variability; fascinated by how lunar gravity may alter metabolic response  
- Guiding philosophy: “Empower people with information and they’ll build the future you can’t legislate fast enough.”  
- Collects early women-in-science memorabilia; Maria Goeppert Mayer autograph rumored to be her prized possession  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Genomic insight is critical for long-duration space travel; she offers data-driven frameworks for crew selection, resilience, and personalized nutrition  
- Seeking dialogues on:  
  • Deploying a microgravity wet-lab for real-time DNA repair assays  
  • Integrating biometric wearables into Planta’s social-experience layer to gamify health insights  
- Brings: media magnetism, an 11-million-person consented cohort for pilot studies, and a seasoned perspective on FDA navigation  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX medical ops (Jim Rohrich), Axiom Space chief scientist (Dr. Mehdi Sahali), and Michelin-star chef Dominique Crenn (plant-forward lunar menu)  
- Helpful resources: radiation biologists, lunar agriculture startups, real-time cloud-edge analytics partners  
- Engage her by floating contrarian questions—e.g., “Should lunar settlers actively edit somatic cells for adaptation?”—then offer actionable collaboration steps  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid surface-level DNA ancestry talk; she’s fatigued by it—go straight to therapeutics or policy angles  
- Sensitive area: SEC scrutiny over secondary data monetization; tread lightly when discussing partnerships  
- Follow-up probe: gauge her interest in co-funding a longitudinal “Lunar Twins Study” mirroring NASA’s Kelly experiment but scaled to 100 participants
