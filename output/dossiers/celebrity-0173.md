### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Marcus Rashford

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Manchester, UK (city-centre loft near club training ground)
- Regular London presence for government & charity meetings; quarterly trips to Los Angeles and Miami to meet entertainment partners
- Pattern: squeezes 48-hour “learning sprints” into away-game layovers—often visits local literacy initiatives or food tech labs

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Forward, Manchester United & England; 380+ senior appearances, 130+ club goals
- Founder, Marcus Rashford Foundation (child food security & youth literacy)
- Children’s author, “You Are a Champion” series; Penguin Random House partner
- Early investor/advisor: Plant-Power Foods (affordable, nutrient-dense ready meals)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Peak conditioning for England’s 2026 World Cup campaign; hiring data-science team to personalise sleep & recovery
- Pre-launch of “Full-Time Futures”: a nationwide programme pairing sport with STEM micro-scholarships
- Quiet diligence on a hydroponic nutrition startup exploring micro-gravity crop trials—seeking 2027 ISS demo slot
- Personal goal: complete private pilot license by late-2025 to reduce travel friction and inspire aviation curiosity among under-served kids

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects vintage NASA mission patches; can recite Apollo flight logs from memory
- Studies British Sign Language in evening sessions—believes “communication shouldn’t be gated by sound”
- Enjoys speed-solving Rubik’s Cubes (sub-60-second average) as pre-match focus ritual
- Guiding maxim: “Visibility breeds responsibility—if I can see the gap, I own a piece of the solution”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Dinner Party as a test-bed for equitable nutrition in extreme environments; wants to understand how lunar agriculture pipelines could inform Earth-side school meal systems
- Intent on meeting space-crop scientists, immersive-tech storytellers, and policy shapers willing to pilot “Moon-Meal” lesson kits for UK classrooms
- Brings star power that attracts mainstream press coverage and galvanises public engagement around Planta’s social-impact narrative

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Dr. Anika Bose (Orbital AgTech lead) – potential R&D partner  
  • Chef Kei Sasaki (nutrition-forward Michelin star) – recipe co-development for school menus  
  • LunaWave VR Studio – explore “walk a mile on the Moon” empathy modules for students
- Ask attendees for: case studies on closed-loop food systems, sponsorship of pilot classrooms, mentorship for ex-academy athletes entering tech
- Engagement tips: open with an off-beat stats question ("fastest cube time?"); transition to how micro-gravity crop yields compare to urban hydroponics; finish by sharing one action you’ll take to close a social gap

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: stays clear of Manchester United contract speculation—respect the boundary
- Prefers concise, purpose-led dialogue; appreciates follow-ups via WhatsApp voice notes over email
- Follow-up probe: gauge interest in becoming official Planta “Nutritional Equity” ambassador for post-lunar public education campaign
