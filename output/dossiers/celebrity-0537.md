- Secondary residences: Los Angeles (film office) & White Bay Cay, Bahamas (private retreat/writers’ residency under quiet development)
- Travel rhythm: Bi-weekly hops between ATL-LAX; quarterly trips to NYC & Washington DC for policy and philanthropy; has begun exploratory visits to Houston & Cape Canaveral for aerospace partnerships

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW

  • Closed $800 M multi-year slate financing with two streamers, retaining 100 % IP ownership

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Phase-III studio build-out: 180-degree LED “volumetric lunar” stage slated for Q4 2026
- Quiet R&D cell (“Project Ascender”) evaluating in-situ space production—target: first dramatized short filmed in lunar-gravity simulation by 2028
- Publishing memoir-style business masterclass (“From Stage to Stratosphere”) autumn 2025
- Personal horizon: finishing instrument rating—wants to pilot his own Gulfstream for remote shoots; experimenting with hydroponic farming on his Bahamian island

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Conversation hooks: vintage typewriter restoration; gospel piano improv sessions; carpentry (“still builds his own writing desks”)
- Guiding philosophy: “Ownership is the oxygen of freedom.” Quotes mentor Oprah’s line, “Turn your wounds into wisdom.”
- Enthralled by the idea of faith communities in off-world colonies—sees spirituality as missing from most sci-fi narratives

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Master storyteller exploring lunar production tech; The Planta Network’s moon dinner aligns with his vision of narrative set in extra-terrestrial habitats
- Seeking dialogue around: human-centric design of lunar living spaces, rights management for off-Earth content, and inclusive cultural storytelling in space
- Value to event: Can chronicle the dinner as proof-of-concept mini-doc; amplifies reach through 35 M social followers & BET+ special

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: Axiom Space media division, NASA Artemis comms director, SpaceX Starlink content bandwidth team, immersive chef José Andrés (for on-camera culinary narrative)
- Ways attendees can help: Access to lunar habitat schematics for set accuracy, investment co-partners for $60 M virtual-production soundstage, advisors on zero-gravity cinematography
- Engagement suggestions: Ask about his plan to turn White Bay Cay into a retreat for underrepresented creators; share any personal faith traditions you’d take to the moon

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Dislikes “Madea first” branding—prefers forward-looking topics; values directness, despises Hollywood small talk
- Under-wraps initiative: 2027 scholarship fund for New Orleans youth to study aerospace engineering; a heartfelt topic if trust is built
- Follow-up queries: confirm readiness date of volumetric stage; gauge interest in co-hosting a VR writers’ room on lunar empathy themes
