### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Sara Seager

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Dual Canadian-U.S. citizen; primary base in Cambridge, MA (MIT campus)
- Monthly commute to Washington, D.C. for NASA and National Academies briefings
- Routinely disappears for week-long “deep thinker” retreats in the Quebec wilderness—no devices, notebook only

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Class of 1941 Professor of Planetary Science & Physics, MIT; leads Seager Group (exoplanet atmospheres & biosignatures)
- Principal Investigator, ASTRO-BioSAT (small-sat mission testing biosignature-gas sensors, 2028 launch window)
- MacArthur “Genius” Fellow; author of New York Times–listed memoir “The Smallest Lights in the Universe”

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Securing final Congressional support for NASA’s Starshade technology demo (in-space formation-flying petals to image Earth-like exoplanets)
- Fast-tracking a lunar-based UV spectrograph concept—leveraging the Moon’s airless environment for ultra-stable observations
- Personal goal: turn field notebooks from her device-free retreats into a popular-science book on “Quiet Data” by 2027
- Training for a sub-orbital parabolic flight to fine-tune handheld gas-analysis hardware under micro-g

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Backcountry canoeist and wilderness-first-responder; believes nature immersion yields the “cleanest hypotheses”
- Collects vintage star charts; favorite quote: “Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence—except in instrumentation budgets.”
- Secret creative outlet: writes minimalist haiku about orbital mechanics; publishes under a pseudonymous blog with ~2 k loyal readers

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Views the lunar dinner as an ideal sandbox to discuss onsite astronomy labs and in-situ resource utilization for optical coatings
- Hopes to meet hardware engineers fluent in additive manufacturing under reduced gravity
- Offers deep expertise on how human-centered storytelling accelerates public buy-in for audacious space projects

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: 
  • Lunar construction consortium leads (ICON, Astrobotic)  
  • Philanthropic science donors eyeing $50–100 M “moonshot” grants  
  • Chefs or food scientists experimenting with plant-based life-support crops—potential collaboration for closed-loop biomes
- Attendees can assist by sharing lessons on human factors in confined habitats—critical for her proposed 30-day “astronomer-in-residence” lunar pilot
- Best engagement tactic: open with an unexpected bio-analogy (e.g., “What molecule would you invite to dinner on the Moon?”)

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: first husband’s passing still shapes her advocacy for life-insurance reforms for astronauts’ families—approach gently
- Prefers precise, math-rooted language; dislikes “space tourism” hype
- Follow-up probe: gauge interest in joining Planta’s advisory board on “Experiential Science Communication”
