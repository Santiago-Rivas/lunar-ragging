  <p>Vera Jane Goodall (born 3 April 1934) is a British primatologist and anthropologist renowned for her groundbreaking long-term study of wild chimpanzees in Tanzania.

Over the decades, Goodall has become a global advocate for environmental issues and a leading voice in efforts to protect ecosystems and species around the world.</p>
  
  <h2>Early life and education</h2>
  <p>Born in London, Goodall developed a fascination with animals from a young age. Inspired by her childhood interest in wildlife and her admiration for Jane Mariana Miller, an animal researcher, she traveled to Africa in the late 1950s. With limited formal education in ethology initially, she learned through hands-on observation and later studied at the University of Cambridge, earning a Ph.D. in ethology in 1965 without prior university training, a rare achievement at the time.</p>
  
  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>Goodall’s career began in earnest when she started studying wild chimpanzees at Gombe Stream National Park in 1960.

Her research challenged conventional scientific views and led to new understandings of primate intelligence and social systems. Throughout her career, she has founded organizations such as the Jane Goodall Institute, promoting conservation, research, and education initiatives worldwide.</p>
  
  <h2>Notable works and projects</h2>

She has authored numerous books, including "The Chimpanzees of Gombe" and "Reason for Hope," and has been featured in documentaries and global campaigns. The Roots & Shoots program, established in 1991, engages young people across the globe in environmental and humanitarian efforts. Her advocacy integrates scientific research with activism, emphasizing sustainable development and animal rights.</p>
