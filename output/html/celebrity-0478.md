  <p>Katie Jeanne Bouman, born December 27, 1989, in West Lafayette, Indiana, is an American computer scientist and imaging researcher renowned for her role in developing algorithms that led to the first image of a black hole. Her work has significantly advanced the field of astrophysics and the application of machine learning in scientific imaging. Bouman's contribution to capturing the image of the supermassive black hole in the galaxy M87 in 2019 garnered widespread recognition and marked a milestone in observational astronomy.</p>
  
  <h2>Early life and education</h2>
  <p>Bouman grew up in West Lafayette, Indiana, where she developed early interests in mathematics and physics. She earned a Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Purdue University. Pursuing her fascination with imaging and computational science, she completed a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Her doctoral research focused on medical imaging techniques using computer vision and machine learning algorithms.</p>
  
  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>After completing her doctorate, Bouman joined the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration, a worldwide network of radio telescopes working together to image black holes. She contributed to the development of sophisticated algorithms capable of reconstructing images from complex, sparse data collected by the EHT. Her work played a vital role in producing the historic 2019 image of the black hole in M87, published in the journal <em>Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>. Since then, she has continued research in high-dimensional data analysis, deep learning applications, and scientific visualization, advocating for diversity in STEM fields.</p>
  
  <h2>Notable works and projects</h2>
  <p>Bouman is best known for her pivotal role in the Event Horizon Telescope project, which achieved the first direct image of a black hole's event horizon. Her algorithms for radio interferometry and image synthesis have been widely adopted in astrophysics and medical imaging. She has also engaged in public outreach, discussing the significance of black holes and the importance of AI in science, inspiring a new generation of scientists and engineers.</p>
  
  <h2>Personal life</h2>
  <p>While maintaining a focus on her scientific pursuits, Bouman is known for her commitment to education and promoting STEM among women and underrepresented groups.
