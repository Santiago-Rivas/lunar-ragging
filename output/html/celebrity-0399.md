  <p>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. She was a pioneer in computer programming and played a key role in developing the first compiler, which translated instructions into machine code. Hopper is also credited with popularizing the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches. Her groundbreaking work contributed significantly to the development of the COBOL programming language, which became one of the first high-level programming languages used widely in business and government applications.</p>

  <h2>Early life and education</h2>
  <p>Hopper was born in New York City in 1906. She showed an early interest in mathematics and science, excelling in her studies. She attended Vassar College, earning a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1928. She continued her education at Yale University, where she earned a master's degree in arts in 1930 and a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1934. Her academic background laid a strong foundation for her later work in computing.</p>

  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>During World War II, Hopper joined the U.S. Navy in 1943, serving at the Bureau of Ships Computation Laboratory at Harvard University. She was assigned to program the Mark I computer, one of the earliest electromechanical computers. After the war, she remained in the Navy Reserve, achieving the rank of rear admiral and serving until her retirement in 1986. Simultaneously, she worked at Remington Rand (later Sperry Corporation), where she developed the first compiler for a programming language, significantly advancing software development. Hopper's work helped standardize programming practices and laid the groundwork for future programming languages.</p>

  <h2>Notable works and projects</h2>
  <p>Hopper's most notable achievement was her role in creating the A-0 compiler, which was a precursor to modern compilers. She also contributed to the development of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language), designed to make programming more accessible for business applications. Her efforts in standardizing programming languages and her advocacy for computer education helped set the stage for widespread adoption of software technology. Hopper is also remembered for popularizing the term "debugging" after removing a moth from a computer relay in 1947.</p>

  <h2>Personal life</h2>
  <p>Hopper married Vincent Foster Hopper in 1930; the couple remained together until his death in 1976. Known for her wit and practicality, she was also noted for her dedication to mentoring young engineers and her advocacy for computer literacy. She often emphasized the importance of continuous learning. Hopper was passionate about education and science policy and encouraged individuals to pursue careers in technology and engineering.</p>

  <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
  <p>Hopper received numerous awards, including the National Medal of Technology in 1991 and the Defense Distinguished Service Medal. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 posthumously. The U.S. Navy named a large naval ship, USS Hopper (DDG-70), in her honour. She was also inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame and received the IEEE Emanuel R. Piore Award. Her legacy continues to inspire generations of computer scientists and engineers.</p>

  <h2>Legacy and impact</h2>
  <p>Grace Hopper's pioneering work in computer science helped transform computing from a specialized activity into an accessible and practical tool used worldwide. Her advocacy for programming standards and education set foundational principles for software engineering. The terms and concepts she popularized—such as "debugging" and "compiler"—are now fundamental to technology. She remains an enduring symbol of innovation, perseverance, and the importance of lifelong learning.</p>
