  <p>Professor Muhammad Yunus is a Bangladeshi social entrepreneur, economist, and banker renowned for pioneering the concepts of microcredit and microfinance. His work has focused on empowering impoverished communities by providing small loans to those excluded from traditional banking systems. Yunus's efforts have contributed significantly to alleviating poverty in Bangladesh and around the world, earning him international recognition and the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.</p>

  <h2>Early life and education</h2>
  <p>Born in Chittagong in 1940, Yunus pursued physics at the University of Dhaka, earning his bachelor's degree in 1960. He later completed his master’s degree and doctorate in economics from Vanderbilt University in the United States. Inspired by his encounters with impoverished communities in Bangladesh during his studies, he dedicated his career to addressing economic inequality and poverty reduction.</p>

  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>Yunus began his academic career as a professor of economics at Chittagong University. In 1976, during a visit to a rural village, he observed the plight of impoverished women unable to access credit. This inspired the creation of the Grameen Bank, a microfinance institution aiming to lend small amounts to the poor without collateral. His innovative approach to microcredit revolutionized development economics and global poverty alleviation efforts. The model expanded across many countries, facilitating small-scale entrepreneurship and social mobility among marginalized populations.</p>

  <h2>Notable works and projects</h2>
  <p>Besides founding Grameen Bank, Yunus has launched numerous programs focused on social business, community development, and education. His concept of "social business" emphasizes profitable ventures that prioritize social goals over profits. Yunus has written several books, including <i>Banker to the Poor</i> and <i>Creating a World Without Poverty</i>, exploring his philosophies and the potential for business to serve humanity. He has also participated in global initiatives, advocating for financial inclusion, women’s empowerment, and sustainable development.</p>

  <h2>Personal life</h2>
  <p>Yunus is married to Ekubuy Rani and has children who support his work. Known for his humble lifestyle and unwavering dedication to social causes, he is a firm advocate of social justice and poverty eradication. Despite international fame, he remains rooted in grassroots activism, emphasizing the importance of grassroots leadership and community participation. His pursuits extend beyond economics into peacebuilding and human development initiatives.</p>

  <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
  <p>Yunus has received numerous awards globally, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, which he shared with Grameen Bank. Other accolades include the Presidential Medal of Freedom (United States), the Independence Day Award (Bangladesh), and the Congressional Gold Medal. His influence extends through honorary degrees and recognition from international organizations for his innovative approach to poverty reduction and social enterprise development.</p>

  <h2>Legacy and impact</h2>
  <p>Yunus’s microfinance model has transformed the way development organizations address poverty, extending financial services to millions of the world's poorest. His work has demonstrated that small loans, when effectively managed and trust-based, can empower the impoverished to start businesses, improve living standards, and foster sustainable economic growth. His philosophy continues to inspire social entrepreneurs and policy reform worldwide, contributing to the paradigm shift towards inclusive development and social justice.</p>
