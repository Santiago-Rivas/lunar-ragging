  <p>Edward Osborne Wilson (20 June 1929 – 26 December 2021) was an American biologist, ecologist, and entomologist renowned for his pioneering work on biodiversity, sociobiology, and the ecological understanding of life. His research on ants and their social behaviors significantly advanced myrmecology. Wilson’s writings and scientific contributions have profoundly shaped modern ecology and conservation biology, emphasizing the importance of preserving Earth's biological diversity. His advocacy for environmental issues and understanding of humanity’s place within the natural world have left a lasting legacy in both science and policy.</p>
  
  <h2>Early life and education</h2>
  <p>Wilson was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and developed an early fascination with insects, particularly ants. During his childhood, he collected and studied insects extensively. He enrolled at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, earning his bachelor's degree in 1950. Wilson continued his studies at Harvard University, where he obtained a doctorate in biology in 1955. His thesis focused on the behavior and systematics of ants, laying the foundation for his lifelong scientific pursuits. Throughout his education, Wilson's interest deepened in understanding the complexities of biological communities and the interdependence of species.</p>
  
  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>Wilson's academic career began with professorships at Harvard University, where he conducted much of his groundbreaking research. He published numerous influential books and scientific papers, notably <em>Sociobiology: The New Synthesis</em> in 1975, which established the field of sociobiology—studying social behavior through evolutionary principles. His work extended beyond academia into conservation, where he championed efforts to preserve endangered ecosystems and species. Wilson’s advocacy contributed to the establishment of protected areas and the promotion of biodiversity as a critical component of planetary health. His scientific achievements earned him numerous awards, including two Pulitzer Prizes for general non-fiction.</p>
  
  <h2>Notable works and projects</h2>
  <p>Wilson authored several pivotal books that made science accessible to the broader public, including <em>The Diversity of Life</em> (1992), which explores the richness of Earth's species and the threats they face. He was involved in numerous research projects on biodiversity hotspots worldwide, aiming to document and promote preservation. The E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation was established to support conservation science and education initiatives. Wilson's work on ants, including his monographs on Formicidae, remains foundational in entomology. His concept of biophilia—the innate human affinity for nature—has influenced environmental conservation policies globally.</p>
  
  <h2>Personal life</h2>
  <p>Wilson married Irene Whalen in 1960, and the couple had one child. Known for his modesty and dedication, Wilson was deeply committed to scientific inquiry and conservation. He was an avid reader and often emphasized the importance of fostering a connection between humans and nature for the sustainability of life on Earth. Wilson’s passion for understanding the natural world was evident both in his professional work and his personal life. He was also a recipient of honorary degrees and numerous accolades recognizing his scientific and environmental contributions.</p>
  
  <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
  <p>Wilson received many distinguished awards, including the National Medal of Science (1976), the Crafoord Prize from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1990), and two Pulitzer Prizes for general nonfiction (1994 and 2006). His recognition extended worldwide, reflecting his influence across scientific disciplines and environmental activism. In 2007, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, honoring his efforts to safeguard biodiversity and advance biological sciences.</p>
  
  <h2>Legacy and impact</h2>
  <p>Wilson’s pioneering scientific insights transformed the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. His emphasis on biodiversity has informed conservation strategies worldwide and increased public awareness of ecological issues. The concept of biophilia has inspired initiatives to reconnect humanity with nature, advocating for sustainable living and environmental responsibility. Wilson's interdisciplinary approach bridged science, philosophy, and policy, shaping the modern understanding of Earth's biological wealth. His legacy endures through ongoing conservation efforts, scholarly research, and the communities he inspired to value and protect the natural environment.</p>
