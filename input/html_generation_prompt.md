**ROLE & PURPOSE**

You are charged with producing a **stand‑alone HTML document** that reads like a concise Wikipedia article for a single individual.

The system will pass you only:

- `INDIVIDUAL_NAME` ‑ the person’s full name.

You may rely on widely available public facts up to today’s date and sensibly infer minor connecting details.  Do **not** fabricate sensational claims or rumors.

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

1. **Return *only* valid HTML markup.** No markdown fences, comments, or extra text.
2. Begin with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and include `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
3. element: `INDIVIDUAL_NAME – Profile`.
4. Embed minimal, self‑contained CSS inside a single `<style>` block in `<head>` to ensure basic readability:
    
    ```css
    body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 2rem auto; max-width: 960px; line-height: 1.5; }
    aside.infobox { float: right; width: 280px; margin: 0 0 1rem 1.5rem; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 0.5rem; font-size: 0.9rem; }
    aside.infobox h3 { text-align: center; margin-top: 0; }
    aside.infobox table { width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; }
    aside.infobox td { padding: 0.25rem 0; vertical-align: top; }
    h1 { margin-top: 0; }
    footer.categories { font-size: 0.8rem; color: #555; border-top: 1px solid #ddd; padding-top: 0.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; }
    
    ```
    
5. **Structural anatomy inside `<body>` (in this order):**
    
    ```html
    <h1>INDIVIDUAL_NAME</h1>
    <aside class="infobox"> …key facts table… </aside>
    <p><!-- LEAD SUMMARY --> … </p>
    
    <h2>Early life and education</h2>
    <p>…</p>
    
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>…</p>
    
    <h2>Notable works and projects</h2>
    <p>…</p>
    
    <h2>Personal life</h2>
    <p>…</p>
    
    <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
    <p>…</p>
    
    <h2>Legacy and impact</h2>
    <p>…</p>
    
    <h2>References</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>...</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ol>
    
    <footer class="categories">Categories: ...</footer>
    
    ```
    
6. **Infobox guidelines** (inside `<aside>`):
    - Title row `<h3>INDIVIDUAL_NAME</h3>`.
    - Use a two‑column `<table>`; left cell label (bold), right cell value.
    - Include rows you can confidently fill: Full name, Birth date & place, Nationality, Occupation(s), Years active, Notable works/roles, Website.
    - Omit any row without reliable info.
7. Maintain neutral, third‑person tone; avoid first‑person or promotional language.
8. Approximate total length: **400–600 words** (lead + sections).
9. No emojis, JavaScript, external assets, or inline SVG.

  <p>Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini (born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. Renowned for his close control, vision, and prolific goalscoring, he spent more than two decades with FC Barcelona, where he became the club’s all‑time top scorer and won a record number of Ballons d’Or. Following spells at Paris Saint‑Germain and Major League Soccer side Inter Miami CF, Messi captained Argentina to victory at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, cementing his legacy on both club and international stages.</p>

  <h2>Early life and education</h2>
  <p>Messi was raised in a football‑loving family in Rosario, the third of four children. Diagnosed at age 10 with growth hormone deficiency, he moved to Spain in 2000 after FC Barcelona offered to fund his medical treatment. While training at La Masia, the club’s celebrated youth academy, he completed compulsory schooling in Catalonia and emerged as a standout talent in youth competitions.</p>

  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>Messi made his senior debut for Barcelona in 2004 at 17. Over 17 seasons he scored 672 goals in competitive matches, guiding the team to 10 La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League crowns. Financial constraints forced his departure in 2021, leading to two seasons with Paris Saint‑Germain where he added Ligue 1 titles and became the world’s leading international goal provider. In 2023 he signed with Inter Miami CF, boosting MLS viewership and winning the inaugural Leagues Cup with a series‑leading 10 goals.</p>

  <h2>Notable works and projects</h2>
  <p>Beyond club achievements, Messi’s international career features an Olympic gold medal (2008), the 2021 Copa América, and the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he scored in every knockout round. Off the pitch, the Leo Messi Foundation supports health, education, and sport initiatives for children, partnering with UNICEF and local NGOs across Latin America and Europe.</p>

  <h2>Personal life</h2>
  <p>Messi married childhood sweetheart Antonela Roccuzzo in 2017; the couple have three sons. Known for privacy and a grounded lifestyle, he enjoys mate tea, family barbecues, and video games. Messi holds Spanish citizenship alongside his Argentine nationality and is a devout Roman Catholic.</p>

  <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
  <p>Messi has won eight Ballon d’Or awards (2009–2023), six European Golden Shoes, FIFA World Player of the Year titles, and multiple MVP honours across leagues and tournaments. In 2023 he received Argentina’s Order of the Liberator General San Martín for his contributions to national sports.</p>

  <h2>Legacy and impact</h2>
  <p>Messi’s blend of creativity, consistency, and sportsmanship has influenced a generation of footballers and analysts. His record‑breaking statistics, especially in dribbling and goal creation, set new benchmarks for forwards. Economically, his transfers spiked merchandising and broadcast figures, and his charitable endeavors have raised millions for pediatric healthcare, reinforcing football’s capacity for social good.</p>
