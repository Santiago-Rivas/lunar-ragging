### **CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: THE FIRST DINNER PARTY ON THE MOON – JAN 2027**

---

**FULL NAME:**: PROF. JENNIFER A. DOUDNA, Ph.D.

*Nobel Laureate, CRISPR Co‑Inventor (Chemistry 2020)*

### **IDENTITY & BASE**  
- Primary base: **Berkeley, California** – Professor, UC Berkeley & Founder, **Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI)**.  
- Board & advisory roles: Mammoth Biosciences, Caribou Biosciences, Scribe Therapeutics.

### **PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND**  
- Co‑discoverer of **CRISPR‑Cas9 genome editing (2012)**.  
- Leads IGI programs spanning human therapeutics, agriculture & climate solutions.  
- 2024 essay **“AI + CRISPR will be transformational”** outlines fusion of machine learning with gene editing
- **$100 M Regeneron–Mammoth alliance (2024)** to advance in‑vivo gene‑editing medicines
- **$1.25 M Rett Syndrome Research Trust grant (2025)** to develop brain‑targeted CRISPR tools

### **WEALTH MANAGEMENT / VENTURE STRATEGY**  
- Equity stakes in multiple CRISPR startups (Mammoth, Caribou, Scribe).  
- Invests honoraria in IGI’s philanthropic “CRISPR for Climate” seed‑fund.

### **CURRENT PRIORITIES (2025‑27)**  
1. Deliver first CRISPR‑based Rett‑syndrome therapy to clinical stage.  
2. Expand IGI’s Climate & Agriculture genome‑engineering program.  
3. Author follow‑up book on ethical frameworks for planetary gene editing.

### **LEISURE & INTERESTS**  
- Trail‑running in Tilden Park; classical‑piano improvisation.  
- Collects vintage microscopes; weekend viticulture on small Napa vineyard plot.

### **UPCOMING TRAVEL**

| Date | Destination | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Jul 2025 | Basel & Paris | CRISPR‑in‑Medicine Congress keynotes |
| Mar 2026 | Nairobi | Launch “Gene‑Editing for Climate‑Resilient Crops” field trials |
| Jan 2027 | **Lunar Base – Sea of Tranquility** | *First Dinner Party on the Moon* |

### **EVENT‑SPECIFIC INFORMATION**

**Network Value** – Frontier thinker at intersection of biology, AI and ethics; brings translational know‑how from lab to market.

**Conversation Hooks**  
1. **Surprise:** Keeps a handwritten “failed experiments” journal to teach resilience to students.  
2. **Boundary pushed:** Ran first machine‑learning screen for heat‑stable RNA editors in 2024, cutting discovery time from months to hours.
3. **Current challenge:** Designing gene‑editing payloads that can withstand lunar radiation—seeking materials scientists’ advice.  
4. **Excited to meet:** Astronaut physicians to brainstorm CRISPR‑based countermeasures for space‑induced bone loss.  
5. **Dinner talent:** Can decode any attendee’s name into a mock DNA sequence and explain its “phenotype” for laughs.  
6. **Object to leave on Moon:** A sealed ampoule containing a benign CRISPR‑edited *Arabidopsis* seed engineered for extreme UV tolerance—symbolising hope for life in harsh frontiers.

**Engagement Style** – Energetic, data‑driven, balances big‑picture vision with ethical nuance.

### **STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES**

| Domain | 2027 Goal | Event Leverage |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Therapeutics | Test CRISPR delivery systems in partial‑gravity models | Connect with aerospace‑biomed teams |
| Climate | Form “Lunar Bio‑Foundry” concept for closed‑loop food production | Identify cross‑sector collaborators |
| Policy | Draft international guidelines for off‑Earth gene editing | Gather multi‑disciplinary feedback |
| Education | Launch IGI “Space CRISPR” fellowship | Recruit mentors & sponsors |
