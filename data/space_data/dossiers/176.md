### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Robert Lewandowski

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Barcelona, Spain  
- Maintains residences in Warsaw and Munich; monthly hops to London & Zurich for board meetings and fintech reviews  
- Off-season pattern: two-week altitude retreats in the Swiss Alps for metabolic testing

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Striker & captain, FC Barcelona; Poland’s all-time top scorer  
- Founder, RL9 Labs – a performance-nutrition and wearables venture studio (seeded €45 M, 11 active bets)  
- Strategic partner, OandaX Capital (sports/entertainment–focused private equity, $500 M AUM)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Transition blueprint from elite athlete to full-time investor by mid-2027  
- Piloting “Zero-G Fuel,” a plant-based micro-nutrition line designed for low-gravity environments (co-developed with ESA food scientists)  
- Growing RL9 Foundation’s STEM-through-football program to 20 European cities; first Asia hub opens Q4 2025 in Singapore  
- Personal ambition: complete an executive MBA in Sustainability Leadership (IESE, class of ’26)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Obsessive about biometric data; tests breath-acetone sensors and glucose micro-patches on himself before endorsing them  
- Enjoys woodworking—built his own minimalist coffee bar at the Warsaw home (“my meditation away from pitches”)  
- Guiding mantra: “Consistency is talent’s best friend.” Frequently quotes Viktor Frankl on purpose-driven performance  
- Secret fascination: lunar geology since childhood; keeps a framed Apollo 11 soil analog on his office shelf

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence underscores the crossover of elite human performance, nutrition tech, and experiential community building beyond Earth  
- Seeking candid feedback on “Zero-G Fuel” palatability from varied palates in an actual lunar setting  
- Wants to trade notes on micro-gravity muscle atrophy research with biotech or NASA-adjacent attendees  
- Offers star power, global sports reach, and a 19-million-follower social platform for post-event storytelling

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Ideal intros:  
  • Dr. Mei Tan (Planta’s sensory neuroscientist) for co-creating mindful eating protocols in space  
  • Artemis Ventures partner Dennis Luo (VC fund specializing in off-planet logistics)  
  • Chef-astronaut José Andrés for culinary R&D collaboration  
- Attendees can assist by sharing data on circadian rhythm management under lunar day-night cycles  
- Best engagement: invite him to the pre-dinner VR simulation walk; he enjoys gamified challenges and friendly competition

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers question-driven dialogue over compliments; warm-up with a specific metric (“How did your VO₂ max respond to low-O₂ Alpine sprints this March?”)  
- Sensitive angle: Retirement rumors—he’ll discuss future clubs freely but swerves speculation on final season chronology  
- Follow-up curiosity: verify progress on RL9 Labs’ Series A for its haptic recovery sleeve (closing target: €30 M)  
- Suggested “surprising fact” prompt: his proficiency in Morse code learned during pandemic lockdowns to sharpen focus
