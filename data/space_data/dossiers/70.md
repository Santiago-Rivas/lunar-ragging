### CURRENT PRIORITIES

- Devours sci-fi classics; cites Arthur C. Clarke as creative spark for latest songwriting structures  
- Keeps a low-key photography habit—35 mm film only, likes candid, grainy textures; offers great ice-breaker for gear enthusiasts  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers informal, humor-laden dialogue; avoid press-style interrogation—values authenticity over polish  
- Sensitive topic: avoids deep discussion of father Julio or relationship gossip—stick to future-facing subjects  
- Follow-up Q: Would he commit a 15-minute acoustic set inside Planta’s VR dome if AV latency tests succeed?
