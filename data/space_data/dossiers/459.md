### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jacqueline Novogratz

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Tribeca, New York City
- Regular 4–6 week circuits to Nairobi, Mumbai, Bogotá for portfolio diligence and leadership academies
- Annual silent-retreat week in upstate New York every December; fiercely protected time

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Acumen (>$150 M patient-capital fund backing social enterprises in 14 countries)
- Board member, World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on the Future of Social Innovation
- Author of two bestsellers; newest book, “Moral Revolution 2.0,” due Q1 2026

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing $300 M Acumen “Regeneration Fund” focused on climate-resilient agriculture and circular-economy tech
- Piloting a lunar-analog farming fellowship in the Atacama Desert with ESA scientists—testing inclusive ownership models for extraterrestrial food systems
- Building a digital platform to scale her Moral Leadership curriculum from 1 K to 100 K emerging leaders within 12 months
- Personally exploring cross-sector collaborations that blend art, ethics, and frontier science to shape humanity’s narrative beyond Earth

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong runner; training for a symbolic 3-mile “Moonrise Dash” on a reduced-gravity treadmill during the mission
- Keeps a collection of hand-stitched African textiles—believes stories are “woven, not written”
- Guiding axiom: “Dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth”
- Surprise fact for the host’s question: She studied marine biology in college before pivoting to finance—still scuba dives to map coral health on personal time

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the dinner as a sandbox for designing equitable governance on off-world communities
- Wants candid dialogue on how IP and resource rights can avoid Earth-replicated inequality
- Intends to secure partners for a cross-disciplinary “Lunar Commons Council” incubated by Acumen + Planta
- Brings deep experience in structuring finance vehicles that blend philanthropic, public, and commercial capital—relevant to funding lunar infrastructure responsibly

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to: NASA Office of Technology Transfer, SpaceX’s R&D ethics lead, and Michelin-star chefs experimenting with closed-loop gastronomy
- Offers mentorship to entrepreneurs tackling waste-to-resource conversion and off-grid energy
- Engage her by asking, “How do we bake moral imagination into the first extraterrestrial supply chain?”—she’ll light up and share concrete frameworks

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers small-group dialogues; large-stage spotlights feel performative to her
- Avoid leading with valuation talk; open with impact metrics or human stories
- Follow-up question post-event: gauge her interest in co-authoring a white paper on “Patient Capital for Planetary Settlements” with Planta’s research arm
