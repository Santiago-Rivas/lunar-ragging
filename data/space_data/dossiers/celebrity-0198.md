---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: La Finca district, Madrid; maintains family residence in Mâcon, Burgundy
- Constant travel loop: Madrid → Paris (national team) → U.S. West Coast off-season; occasional weekend hops to Chantilly racecourse to inspect his horses

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Vice-captain & all-time leading scorer, Atlético Madrid; contract through June 2027 with exit clause timed to post-World Cup transition
- 2018 FIFA World Cup champion, 2022 finalist; UEFA Nations League winner
- Founder, Grizi Esport (multi-game roster in Europe & LATAM); angel investor in three sports-tech startups (VR fan engagement, wearables, nutritional genomics)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Chasing a final Champions League run with Atlético before exploring an MLS stint (Miami & LA clubs already circling)
- Expanding Grizi Esport into immersive VR tournaments—prototype event slated for Gamescom 2026
- Building “Grizi Green” initiative: carbon-neutral training centers powered by agrivoltaic tech on unused family vineyard plots
- Personal ambition: earn a private-pilot license; weekly simulator sessions in Madrid
- Family focus: securing bilingual schooling options in California for his two children, anticipating a 2027 relocation window

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong comic-book collector (French BD & Marvel first editions); trades via discreet Paris dealers
- Owns six thoroughbred racehorses; studies bloodline analytics with the same rigor he applies to match data
- Night-owl gamer—Fortnite & Football Manager handle: “LePetitPrince-7”
- Guiding maxim from Kobe Bryant: “Rest at the end, not in the middle”
- Surprising tidbit he enjoys revealing: sketches lunar landscapes in a private notebook—claims drawing helps visualize “weightless creativity”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: global sports icon amplifying Planta’s “beyond Earth” narrative; firsthand insights on human performance in extreme environments
- Seeking: contacts in space nutrition to explore micro-gravity meal design for elite athletes; VR storytellers to broadcast a future “match in orbit” concept
- Contribution: 120 M+ social following for instant event visibility; willing to film a short zero-gravity ball-control demo in the lunar habitat

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros requested:
  • Axiom Space R&D team (sports experimentation module)
  • Puma Innovation Lab lead on sustainable fiber for lunar conditions
  • Serena Williams’ venture arm—co-invest in athlete-led media IP
- Offer to attendees: advisory slots for seed-stage esports or fan-tech founders; mentorship on athlete brand building
- Engage him by: challenging his knowledge of vintage Tintin “Destination Moon” panels; inviting him to test the AR stargazing overlay during dessert

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers relaxed, humor-laced conversation; praise his tactical IQ rather than raw talent for deeper dialogue
- Avoid prodding into Barcelona transfer saga or 2022 Golden Ball snub—both fatigue him
- Post-event follow-up: send link to pilot training facility tour at Mojave Air & Space Port; he hinted at scheduling lessons there during next U.S. preseason
