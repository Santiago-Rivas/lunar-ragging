### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Denzel Washington

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Beverly Hills, CA  
- Maintains Manhattan apartment for Broadway runs; summer retreat in Martha’s Vineyard  
- Travel rhythm: 6–8 international trips a year tied to film sets, plus quarterly NYC–L.A. shuttle

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Actor, director, producer; co-founder, Mundy Lane Entertainment  
- Two Academy Awards, three Golden Globes, Tony Award for “Fences”  
- Credited with reviving August Wilson’s canon on screen and stage; driving force behind new studio-streamer equity deals for theatrical storytelling

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Directing “The Piano Lesson” (post-production) & assembling financing for the final three Wilson adaptations—aim: complete cycle by 2028  
- Building an immersive-media division inside Mundy Lane to experiment with volumetric capture for VR/AR stage plays  
- Expanding scholarship endowment for Boys & Girls Clubs of America; goal: $50 M fund by 2027  
- Personal stretch project: learning French to prepare for a French-language political thriller he plans to star in and produce

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Off-set hobby: collects antique pocket watches; says the ticking reminds him that “time is the only honest critic”  
- Amateur boxer—still spars weekly at a private gym; uses discipline metaphors when coaching actors  
- New obsession: lunar and deep-sky astrophotography after a 2024 NASA VIP tour; already shooting through a custom Leica–Zeiss rig  
- Guiding philosophy: “Fall forward”—prefers bold, public risks over incremental caution

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Moon dinner as a storytelling laboratory: assessing how extreme environments reshape human performance and audience empathy  
- Wants to meet technologists exploring latency-free holographic telepresence for theatrical distribution beyond Earth  
- Offers: global star power to amplify Planta’s vision; willingness to host a behind-the-scenes documentary segment on-site  
- Unusual personal angle that satisfies the conversation prompt: He sketches costume designs during long flights—keeps a secret notebook with over 200 period outfits

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to:  
  • NASA Artemis crew psychologists (for character research)  
  • Sony Innovation Studios XR team (potential co-production)  
  • Impact investors interested in arts-education endowments  
- Attendees can help by sharing advances in lightweight performance capture suits usable in lunar gravity  
- Engaging him: open with a boxing anecdote or ask which Wilson play best suits a lunar stage—he loves hypotheticals that merge art and environment

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers sincerity over flattery; keep questions concise and mission-oriented  
- Politically low-key in mixed company—avoid dragging him into partisan debates  
- Follow-up after event: invite him to private demo of Planta’s social-VR platform; position it as a tool for rehearsing “space-theater” without leaving Earth
