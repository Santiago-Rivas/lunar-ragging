### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Dominic Thiem

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Lichtenwörth, Lower Austria; maintains training residences in Tenerife (hard-court altitude facility) and Miami during off-season
- Travels 30+ weeks/year on ATP calendar; offseason retreats to Tyrolean Alps for endurance conditioning and quiet reflection

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Professional tennis player, former World No. 3; 2020 US Open Champion and two-time Roland-Garros finalist
- Early investor in performance-tech startups (neuromuscular data wearables, VR reaction-time trainers)
- Sustainability ambassador for Austrian Climate Action Initiative; front-facing credibility with Gen Z eco-audience

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Competitive comeback roadmap: targeting Top 15 ranking by late-2025, eyeing 2026 Davis Cup leadership role
- Co-founding “Thiem Impact Fund” (launch Q4 2025) to back early-stage sports-for-good ventures and regenerative agriculture pilots in Central Europe
- Personal project: prototyping a microgravity training module (resistance bands + gyroscopic stabilizers) to keep athletic conditioning viable in space tourism settings
- Six-month sabbatical from media commitments to deepen Spanish language skills and complete private pilot license (twin-engine rating)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur astrophotographer; keeps a portable deep-sky tracker on tour (“seeing Orion from six continents keeps me grounded”)
- Vegan-leaning foodie—experiments with mycoprotein recipes and ferments; claims kombucha brewing “works the same muscle as a perfect topspin”
- Favorite maxim: “Consistency is just curiosity under discipline.”
- Unusual fact he enjoys revealing: designs closed-ecosystem terrariums and has 30+ thriving moss biospheres in his Austrian basement studio

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited as a high-profile athlete exploring performance frontiers beyond Earth—aligns with Planta’s narrative of pushing human connection past geographic limits
- Seeks dialogue with space architects and biologists on sustainable movement spaces in low gravity for both elite athletes and casual travelers
- Can offer keynote-caliber storytelling on mental resilience, flow states, and the psychology of performing under extreme novelty—valuable color for post-dinner discussion capture

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: 
  • Lunar habitat life-support engineers (to validate terrarium ecosystems at one-sixth gravity)  
  • Deep-tech VCs exploring sports physiology in space  
  • Culinary scientists experimenting with plant-based protein grown in controlled-environment farms
- Willing to mentor young founders in sports tech incubation programs or lend brand capital to pilot studies
- Best engagement tactic: ask him to compare court surfaces to lunar regolith; segue into how rhythm adapts when bounce predictability disappears

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Soft-spoken; benefits from one-on-one conversation before group spotlight
- Avoid probing wrist-injury timeline unless he raises performance rehab himself
- Follow-up questions: status of Impact Fund LP commitments; readiness to beta-test microgravity training prototype during a parabolic flight in 2026
