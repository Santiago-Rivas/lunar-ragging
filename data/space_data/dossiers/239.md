### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Iga Świątek

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Warsaw, Poland (family home + custom indoor clay facility outside the city)
- Secondary hubs: Monte Carlo (sports-science lab partnership) and Miami (pre-season block)
- Nomadic tour calendar: ~35 weeks/year across four continents; off-weeks often spent in mountain altitude camps for recovery

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Current world No. 1 on the WTA Tour; four-time Grand Slam champion and reigning Roland-Garros titleholder
- Founder & Chair, Iga Świątek Foundation for Youth Mental Resilience (launched 2024, endowment USD 18 M)
- Global ambassador: On Running (apparel/footwear), Visa, Rolex, Tecnifibre, LEGO “Women in Sport” series

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Pursuing an Olympic gold medal run in Los Angeles 2028; already building a multidisciplinary support team with NASA-grade sleep and cognitive scientists
- Scaling her foundation’s “Quiet Strength” curriculum into 1,000 European schools by 2026
- Early-stage investor in neurofeedback-wearable start-up ThetaFlow, seeking sports-to-space crossover applications
- Personal: completing glider-pilot certification; aims to earn a suborbital flight endorsement before age 30

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Obsessed with historical fiction—currently annotating Hilary Mantel’s trilogy to polish English nuance
- Drums in a pop-punk side project formed with tour physios; soundcheck doubles as reaction-time training
- Guiding principle: “Discomfort is the data; listen, don’t flinch.” (originated from her sports psychologist sessions)
- Keeps a running list of “unanswerable questions” in a Field Notes booklet—offers great icebreakers

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Moon dinner as the ultimate “away game,” curious how microgravity influences proprioception and fine-motor control (serves, string tension, handwriting)
- Looking to compare astronaut isolation protocols with her own tour mental-health regimen; eager to co-design an experiment for real-time EEG monitoring during the voyage
- Brings global youth audience reach (15 M combined followers) and an articulate voice on performance psychology—ideal for pre-event storytelling and post-event content amplification

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: SpaceX Human Performance team, European Space Agency’s behavioral health lead, chefs exploring sensory adaptation in low gravity
- Can offer mentorship to fellow attendees curious about elite-sport routines, and visibility for moon-based STEM education initiatives
- Engagement tip: ask about her glider aerobatic drills; she lights up when parallels between thermals and topspin are noted

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers quiet one-on-one settings before public panels; noise-cancellation options appreciated en route
- Avoid politics of tennis governing bodies—fatigued by tour scheduling debates
- Follow-up query: interest in co-producing a mini-doc on “First racket swung off-Earth” experiment at the lunar base
