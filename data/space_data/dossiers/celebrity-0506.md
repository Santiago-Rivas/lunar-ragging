### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Nandan Nilekani

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Bengaluru, India  
- Maintains work apartments in New Delhi (policy meetings) and Palo Alto (venture ecosystem)  
- Quarterly circuits through Geneva, Singapore, and Washington D.C. for multilateral digital-public-infrastructure (DPI) briefings  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & Non-Executive Chairman, Infosys (NYSE: INFY)  
- Founding architect of Aadhaar (1.3 B biometric IDs); now global evangelist for open DPI “rails”  
- Chair, ONDC—India’s interoperable e-commerce network; Co-chair, UN High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling ONDC internationally—pilot MoUs with Kenya, Brazil, and Indonesia by Q4 2025  
- Launching $250 M “DPI for Climate” fund to back low-carbon supply-chain primitives  
- Building EkStep 2.0: AI-tutor platform targeting 100 M learners by 2027  
- Personal goal: write third book on “Planetary Scale Commons” during 2026 sabbatical  
- Training regimen for lunar visit—has already completed ESA’s zero-G parabolic flights, keen on demonstrating that citizens over 70 can still qualify for off-world travel  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects 17th-century star charts; fascinated by how early explorers mapped the unknown  
- Enjoys long-distance cycling; entries logged as proxy data for productivity correlations  
- Guiding maxim: “Public rails, private innovation—trust is the ultimate network effect.”  
- Unexpected skill: coded early Infosys payroll in Lisp; still tinkers with functional programming challenges on flights  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a test-bed for “exo-civil DPI”—digital ID, payments, and supply-chain ledgers that work beyond national jurisdictions  
- Wants candid dialogue on governance models for multi-nation lunar settlements; particularly identity-linked resource allocation  
- Offers 40 years of scaling lessons, potential catalytic capital, and global policy access for any Moon-base consortium adopting open standards  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Artemis sustainability office; ESA Moon Village Association; Y Combinator space-tech cohort; World Central Kitchen (closed-loop food systems)  
- Could benefit from chefs experimenting with algae-based proteins (links to EkStep’s nutrition-literacy modules)  
- Engage him by proposing concrete, first-100-day interoperability challenges for lunar networks; present data, not hype—he enjoys whiteboard problem-solving over dessert  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers concise exchanges; bring a sharp statistic or provocative question within the first minute  
- Politically neutral in public; avoid pulling him into partisan Indian policy debates  
- Follow-up queries: status of ISO working group on “Off-World Digital Identity”; interest level in endowing a Moon-based learning lab under EkStep
