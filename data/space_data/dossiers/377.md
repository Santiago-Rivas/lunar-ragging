### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Lisa Su

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Santa Clara, CA; maintains condo in Taipei for quarterly visits
- Regular circuits: Austin R&D hub (monthly), Washington D.C. policy briefings (bi-monthly), Davos & WEF tech councils (Jan/May)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chair, President & CEO, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD); architect of the Zen CPU turnaround and current MI300X AI accelerator rollout
- Independent Director, Cisco Systems; member, U.S. National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee
- Credited with tripling AMD market cap (2020-2024) and landing dual exascale wins (Frontier, El Capitan)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing strategic AI platform alliances to secure >25 % data-center share by 2027
- Fast-tracking 3D-chiplet roadmap for radiation-hardened processors aimed at lunar and Mars habitats
- Personal mission: elevate female technical leadership pipeline—intern-to-VP mentoring cohort launches Q3 2025
- Quietly exploring venture investments in gourmet tech (precision fermentation + edge AI quality control) after a sabbatical cooking course in Lyon

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend stress relief: long-range astrophotography from her Los Altos rooftop observatory—loves processing narrowband nebula images
- Collects vintage mechanical watches; fascinated by micro-engineering parallels to chip design
- Favorite maxim: “Execution eats vision for breakfast—then asks for seconds.” 
- Unexpected talent: accomplished jazz saxophonist; has sat in at South by Southwest after-hours sets

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a live testbed for ultra-low-latency, high-radiation compute—ideal showcase for AMD’s upcoming “Selene” space-grade EPYCs
- Aims to gauge gastronomic tech trends for her gourmet tech angel thesis; open to chefs experimenting with AI-driven flavor optimization
- Offers deep insight on supply-chain resilience for off-planet infrastructure; happy to brief guests on chip hardening lessons from the exascale program

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Artemis procurement leads, SpaceX Starshield edge-compute team, and gourmet investor José Andrés for lunar food science collaboration
- Attendees can assist by sharing in-situ data on lunar EM interference patterns—useful for “Selene” validation
- Engage her with thoughtful questions about scaling governance for autonomous systems in non-sovereign space; avoid generic “women in tech” angles

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers rapid-fire Q&A over slide decks; will mentally clock any pitch that exceeds 90 seconds
- Sensitive topic: she is negotiating a multibillion wafer-capacity agreement—avoid probing TSMC allocation specifics
- Follow-up after the event: invite her to a private tasting of AI-formulated lunar-grown herbs (fits both gourmet and chip-sensor interests)
