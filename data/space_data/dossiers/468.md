### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jon Batiste

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Brooklyn Heights, New York
- Secondary creative retreat in New Orleans; returns monthly for family and community engagements
- Regular long-haul travel loop: NYC ↔ LA for film scoring sessions, then Paris or London for orchestral recordings every 6–8 weeks

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Grammy- and Oscar-winning composer, multi-instrumentalist, and former Late Show bandleader
- Founder, Social Music Universe Inc.—studio + R&D hub exploring AI-generated improvisation and spatial audio staging
- Artistic Director-at-Large, National Jazz Museum in Harlem; curates “Future Folkways” series spotlighting tech-infused roots music

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing concept album “Voyager Suite,” designed for 360º lunar-grade surround playback; album dynamically remixes in response to listener biometrics
- Scoring DreamWorks animated feature slated for holiday 2026; experimenting with quantum-generated chord voicings
- Building a venture fund (seed-size) focused on ethical music-tech startups—targets: adaptive wellness soundscapes, low-latency global jam platforms
- Personal mission: expand music-in-schools programs to orbital classrooms by 2028, partnering with SpaceX education arm

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur astrophotographer—keeps a collapsible refractor telescope in tour luggage; trades lunar crater photos with Neil deGrasse Tyson
- Practices “rhythmic meditation”: 12-minute daily body-percussion routine he teaches crews to fight circadian drift on long flights
- Guiding philosophy: “Sound is a portal—shape the portal, you reshape perception.” Often quotes Sun Ra: “Space is the place.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Perfect showcase: “Voyager Suite” debuts best in low-gravity where acoustic decay differs—wants to capture a live STEM/arts hybrid video on the lunar surface
- Seeks collaborators in lunar habitat acoustics, biosensor wearables, and haptic seating to refine the album’s interactive layer
- Brings value: can craft a real-time soundtrack to the dinner using heartbeat data from each guest, providing a memorable, data-driven collective score

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired:  
  • Dr. Yuko Tanaka, JAXA acoustic engineer (lunar acoustic modeling)  
  • Planta Network’s XR team for cross-integration with their social platform  
  • Investors focused on “culture in space” (e.g., Polaris Dawn Fund)
- Attendees can assist by sharing proprietary material specs of the Sea of Tranquility dome to pre-tune resonant frequencies
- Best engagement approach: swap surprising childhood records; he lights up discussing early Bach chorales remixed through New Orleans brass

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Recently declined two major brand deals over restrictive AI-training clauses—values artist data sovereignty
- Avoid small talk about award counts; prefers forward-looking conversations on multisensory storytelling
- Follow-up Q: gauge his interest in co-authoring a white paper on psychoacoustics in extraterrestrial habitats with Planta’s research arm
