### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Pardis Sabeti

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Cambridge, Massachusetts (Broad Institute & Harvard School of Public Health)
- Maintains satellite labs in Abuja, Nigeria and Kenema, Sierra Leone; rotates in 6-week blocks
- Regular circuits through Geneva (WHO advisory board) and Dubai (fundraising for global pathogen-tracking grid)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Professor of Immunology & Infectious Disease, Harvard; Institute Member, Broad Institute
- Founder & Executive Chair, Sentinel Analytics (AI-driven, in-field nanopore sequencing network; Series B closed at $110 M in 2024)
- Pioneered rapid-response genomic tools during Ebola and Lassa outbreaks; TIME 100, TED main-stage, MacArthur “genius” fellow

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Deploying 3,000 “Streetlamp” portable sequencers across sub-Saharan Africa by Q4 2026
- Drafting Global Pathogen Early-Warning Treaty framework for 2028 UN vote
- Integrating bio-surveillance protocols into design specs for lunar and Mars habitats (coordination with NASA HERA analog missions)
- Personal aim: finish “Songs for a Viral Planet” album—recorded partly in reduced-gravity flights—to fund STEM programs for girls in conflict zones

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Leads alt-rock band Thousand Days; travels with a collapsible carbon-fiber guitar
- Thrill-sports devotee (heli-skiing accident survivor, 2021); training for a sub-orbital “guitar in micro-g” performance
- Guiding maxim: “Speed is the antibody.” Believes transparent data sharing outpaces any pathogen or panic
- Keeps cryptogram journals; offers small prizes to teammates who crack her daily cipher

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to advise Planta on microbial containment within closed-loop food systems for the lunar base
- Eager to discuss biome shifts under low gravity and how social isolation alters the human virome
- Wants introductions to space architects building modular med-bay concepts; aims to embed plug-and-play sequencing stations
- Will bring a prototype “Puck-Seq” unit—can live-demo lunar soil or water sample analysis during the dinner

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: ESA MELiSSA leadership, SpaceX Starshield biosecurity team, Lux Capital’s space-health vertical
- Attendees can help by sharing edge-case failure modes (airlock breaches, hydroponic mold blooms) to train Sentinel’s predictive models
- Best engagement: open with music or puzzle talk; propose an impromptu low-g jam session to break the ice
- Offer her co-authorship on a white paper about “Pathogen-Safe Extraterrestrial Hospitality” to fast-track UN and ASTM standards

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: lost a cousin to COVID-19—emotional trigger when discussing pandemic complacency; approach with empathy
- Physical: residual spinal stiffness—prefers standing or gentle walk-and-talk over prolonged seating
- Follow-up questions: gauge interest in a Planta × Sentinel “Lunar Sentinel Node” pilot; ask what data-sharing commitments she expects from private space operators
