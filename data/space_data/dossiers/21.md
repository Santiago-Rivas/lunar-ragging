### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Washington Heights, NYC  
- Secondary bases: Vega Alta, Puerto Rico (family foundation work) & London (West End productions)  
- Travel rhythm: Bi-monthly LA trips for film/TV scoring; annual “writing retreats” in rural Vermont—offline for a week each spring  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Creative polymath: composer-lyricist, actor, producer, and cultural entrepreneur  
- Founder, 5000 Broadway Productions; multi-picture deal with Disney; Hamilton global equity partner (34 active companies)  
- Two Pulitzer Prizes, three Tonys, three Grammys; 2024 Academy Award for Best Original Song (“Encanto 2”)  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Developing an immersive, mixed-reality musical (“Sphere of Sound”) slated for 2028 launch at MSG Sphere Las Vegas  
- Show-running an Apple TV+ limited series on the 1898 Puerto Rican Expeditionary Corps—casting now  
- Fundraising $25 M for Hispanic Federation climate-resilience projects in Caribbean coastal towns  
- Personal: honing Spanish-language freestyle skills; committed to writing one 16-bar verse daily through 2025  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate board-game designer; prototypes cooperative storytelling games in his downtime  
- Collects vintage New York subway tokens—claims the clink helps him find “the pocket” when beatboxing  
- Guiding maxim: “History is just rehearsal—rewrite the scene, change the future.”  
- Hidden talent he enjoys revealing: can flawlessly recite every U.S. state capital backwards in under 90 seconds  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn by the art-tech-frontier fusion; exploring acoustic physics of low-gravity spaces for a future “Lunar Cantata” concept album  
- Seeks collaborators with expertise in spatial audio, XR head-tracking, and astro-botany (for a stage set using living plants)  
- Willing to compose a 90-second freestyle rap summing up the dinner’s key insights—built-in viral content for Planta’s post-event reel  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • NASA Acoustics Lab (Dr. Rana Patel) to discuss resonance in pressurized habitats  
  • Sony Immersive Music Studios (Mark Cerny) for 360-audio capture  
  • Patagonia Action Works for climate grant-matching on Puerto Rico projects  
- Attendee leverage: invite him into an impromptu “word-grenade” game—hand him three lunar-themed words and request a rap; primes him for deeper conversation afterward  
- Offer him a tasting of micro-grown culantro from Planta’s lunar garden—ties directly to his Puerto Rican culinary roots  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers ginger tea over alcohol; motion-sensitivity meds already cleared for lunar flight—avoid jokes about Dramamine  
- Family privacy is paramount; twin sons’ names not public—steer clear  
- Future follow-up: propose a joint Planta-Miranda Foundation program using XR theater in disaster-relief shelters  
- Potential “unusual fact” prompt: ask about his secret teenage stint as a crossword-puzzle test-solver for the NYT—rarely discussed publicly
