- Fitness routine centers on capoeira and zero-gravity training sessions with Blue Origin’s parabolic flights
- Surprising fact: co-owns a small cacao farm in the Volta Region—uses proceeds to fund community tech hubs

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a live case study for bias-free human–AI interaction in extraterrestrial environments
- Seeking partners to co-draft a “Lunar Inclusive Design Charter” addressing lighting, facial recognition accuracy in low gravity, and multicultural social norms
- Brings expertise in fairness audits; can contribute a real-time bias detection demo using the event’s AR headsets
- Wants candid dialogue on preventing colonialist paradigms in space habitation

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA’s Office of Technology, ESA’s Moonlight comms program, SpaceX Starlink ethics lead, Apple Vision Pro inclusive-design team
- Attendees can assist with: lunar lighting data sets, grant matching for Bias Bounty expansion, documentary distribution partners
- Engagement tips: open with an unexpected art reference; invite her to improvise a “moonshot haiku” to spark conversation

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Allergic to shellfish—flag for menu planning
- Prefers small circles over large panels; ideal setting is a semi-private observation deck briefly shielded from cameras
- Avoid excessive futurist hype; she values concrete accountability measures
- Follow-up probe: willingness to host a post-event virtual town hall on space ethics with community activists
