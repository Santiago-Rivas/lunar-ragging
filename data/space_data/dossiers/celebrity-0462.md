**FULL NAME:** Jane Goodall

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Bournemouth, UK; maintains a woodland retreat in Tanzania for periodic field visits  
- Relies on a tight virtual-studio setup to beam into global events, reducing flight frequency; accepts selective in-person engagements that spotlight planetary stewardship

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder, Jane Goodall Institute; UN Messenger of Peace since 2002  
- Catalyst behind “Roots & Shoots,” now spanning 70+ countries with 2 M+ youth participants  
- Advisor to Earth Species Project and several space-agro ecology startups

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Campaigning for legal recognition of “ecosystem personhood” in international law  
- Incubating a closed-loop horticulture initiative that adapts rainforest microbiomes for extraterrestrial greenhouses (partnership with ESA Bio-Support program)  
- Producing a docu-podcast, “Beyond the Canopy,” exploring ethical frontiers of off-world exploration—launch slated for early 2026  
- Personal aim: transition 50 % of global Roots & Shoots chapters to carbon-negative operations by 2027

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong fascination with ethology of non-human intelligence; currently comparing primate social rituals to emerging human-machine rituals  
- Relaxation hobby: sketching lunar phases—keeps a travel-size charcoal set  
- Guiding maxim: “Only when we understand, can we care; only when we care, will we act.”  
- Enjoys swapping plant-based recipes that mimic childhood comfort foods; known to surprise hosts with a homemade chutney jar

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence underscores ethical responsibility as humankind establishes a lunar foothold  
- Keen to discuss: safeguarding pristine lunar sites, integrating biodiversity metrics into habitat design, youth engagement in space governance  
- Seeks collaborators who can pilot Roots & Shoots “Moon Chapter,” channeling student citizen-science toward off-world sustainability challenges  
- Offers decades of experience translating complex science into mass inspiration—valuable for Planta’s storytelling ambitions

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • Lunar environmental standards working group at NASA’s Office of Planetary Protection  
  • Venture arms of Patagonia & Ørsted exploring off-world circular materials  
- Attendees can assist by: providing VR assets of the Sea of Tranquility for use in Roots & Shoots classrooms; sharing data on bioregenerative life-support trials  
- Engagement tips: open with a sincere anecdote about a personal encounter with nature; segue to how lunar exploration may reframe that memory

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- At 91, schedules tightly around rest windows; prefers early-evening dialogues and herbal tea over alcohol  
- Sensitive point: avoids talk of personal legacy in past tense—frame contributions as ongoing  
- Follow-up queries worth exploring: viability of youth-led lunar citizen assemblies; interest in co-authoring an ethical charter for extraterrestrial dining rituals
