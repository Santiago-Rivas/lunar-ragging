### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Olivia Rodrigo

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Angeles (Silver Lake); maintains recording “escape pad” in Big Sur
- Regular bi-coastal hops to NYC for songwriting camps and Broadway scouting  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Singer-songwriter & producer; 3× Grammy-winning debut “SOUR” (2021), platinum follow-up “GUTS” (2023)
- Founder, BitterSweet Records imprint under Geffen/Interscope; mentoring two emerging female artists
- Expanding acting catalogue—attached to A24’s 2026 coming-of-age sci-fi film as executive-producer/star

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Writing cycle for third studio album; experimenting with spatial-audio stems and AI-assisted mixing
- Negotiating 2026-27 global “Gravity” tour with a carbon-negative mandate (partnering with Climeworks)
- Building “Girls Write Loud,” a charitable fund seeding songwriting labs in Title I public schools
- Personal focus: safeguarding mental health amid hyper-visibility; weekly dialectical therapy sessions and digital-wellness advocacy

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Late-night diarist—keeps a Moleskine of one-line “moon thoughts”; quotes Sylvia Plath and Mitski
- Amateur astrophotographer; travels with a compact Sony α7C and collapsible telescope
- Philosophy: “Raw beats perfect”; gravitates to candid stories of vulnerability over polished bravado
- Secret talent: competitive speed-cubing (sub-20 second solves)—relaxes her pre-show nerves

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the symbolism of debut creative experiences in uncharted spaces—already sketching a “first song premiered off-Earth”
- Seeks insight on lunar acoustics, delay curves, and broadcast tech to assess feasibility of a micro-set during the dinner
- Curious how Planta fosters authentic intimacy through tech; wants to translate that ethos into fan communities
- Brings viral reach (200 M+ social followers) and narrative power to spotlight the event’s mission beyond aerospace circles

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions: 
  • Sina Bahram (inclusive design) for sensory-rich concert interfaces  
  • SpaceX’s Gwynne Shotwell re cargo capacity for stage gear on future lunar venues  
  • Patagonia leadership on concert-tour sustainability
- Attendees can assist by sharing miniature recording rigs, VR/AR demo pods, or data on sound propagation in low-gravity habitats
- Engage over shared playlists: she’s compiling a “Zero-G Heartbreak” mixtape—ask what songs belong on it

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers intimate groups (≤4) before opening up; large crowds trigger “press-mode” guardedness
- Sensitive about past licensing battles—avoid generic “driver’s license” jokes
- Follow-up Qs:  
  1) Timing for first singles drop relative to 2026 tour marketing  
  2) Scope for Girls Write Loud chapters outside the US—potential lunar-themed songwriting contest?
