### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects vintage Moog synths and NASA mission badges; claims the hum of the Apollo guidance computer inspired his favorite chord, G-maj-add2

- Weekend obsession: writes Swift code for custom AU plug-ins—keeps a GitHub repo under alias “CP-441Hz”
- Philosophical north star: “Technology should dissolve the barrier between thought and sound.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn by chance to test acoustics in Planta’s pressurized lunar dome; eager to capture impulse responses for album interludes

  • SpaceX acoustics team (Falcon cabin resonance study)

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Under-the-radar fact to surface (aligns with conversation goal): licensed ham-radio operator since age 12; dreams of bouncing a live jam off the moon via Earth–Moon–Earth communication
- Sensitive: Prefers low-lighting to manage occasional optic migraines; schedule any performances before 23:00 lunar time
- Follow-up intel: Confirm if he finalized Dolby Atmos partnership paperwork—could unlock co-branded “First Lunar Mix” press buzz
