### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Fabio Cannavaro

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Naples & Milan; splits time between family home in Naples and a design-forward apartment near Milan’s Navigli
- Monthly shuttles to Doha and Shanghai for consultancy and academy oversight
- Keeps a “72-hour” travel kit permanently packed—habit born during playing days but still applies to today’s speaking and scouting hops

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Executive Chair, Cannavaro Sports Lab—an elite performance analytics and VR-training startup (backed by TechStars Sports 2024 cohort)
- 2006 FIFA World Cup-winning captain; Ballon d’Or recipient (only defender in past three decades to win)
- UEFA Pro-licensed coach; former head coach of Guangzhou Evergrande, Al-Ahli, and a short caretaker stint with the Italian national team in 2024

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Commercial launch of “Defender’s Eye” mixed-reality headset for positional training, targeting Serie A clubs Q3 2025
- Raising a €40 M Series A to expand data capture from pitch-side LIDAR to indoor courts (basketball, volleyball)
- Personal: rewilding project on family vineyard slopes near Vesuvius—turning fallow land into a carbon-negative sports retreat
- Preparing autobiography’s second edition; wants it to double as a leadership playbook for Gen Z athletes

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Quiet obsession with astrophotography—spends off-nights capturing deep-sky images from hotel rooftops; owns a collapsible 8-inch telescope
- Collects mid-century Italian furniture; believes “craftsmanship is the original technology”
- Guiding philosophy: “Structure gives freedom”—applies rigid defensive frameworks so creative players can improvise
- Surprising fact: holds an advanced scuba certification and volunteers with Mediterranean seagrass restoration teams (topic he rarely brings up publicly)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Embodies elite teamwork and high-stakes decision-making—natural draw for an event about pioneering human collaboration off-planet
- Seeking dialogue on motion capture in lunar-gravity environments; curious how altered biomechanics could inform injury-prevention tech on Earth
- Offers charismatic storytelling around pressure, resilience, and uniting disparate personalities toward a single objective—compelling dinner-table content

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Would value introductions to: 
  • SpaceX & Axiom engineers exploring human performance in partial-G  
  • Culinary chemists working with low-gravity food textures (potential collab for sports nutrition line)  
  • Impact investors focused on sports-driven climate solutions
- Could mentor founders building immersive coaching platforms; open to joint pilots using Planta’s social connectivity tools within sports academies
- Best engagement: ask about parallels between defending in the last minute of a World Cup final and protecting a lunar habitat—he lights up when tactics meet big imagination

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers direct, good-humored exchange; silently assesses authenticity within first 30 seconds
- Avoid over-flattering references to 2006 trophy—he appreciates respect but wants to talk future, not nostalgia
- Follow-up probe: feasibility of hosting a youth “Moon Camp” demo using Defender’s Eye; could become marquee storyline for both Planta and Cannavaro Sports Lab
