### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Lady Gaga (Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta)

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: Malibu coastal compound & Tribeca loft; maintains creative studio in Las Vegas (for periodic micro-residencies)
- Regular Europe shuttle—Rome (film work) and Paris (Haus Labs R&D); keeps an open calendar slot every six weeks for “deep-isolation writing retreats” in remote locales

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Global recording artist (13× Grammy, 1× Academy Award); founder, Haus Labs by Lady Gaga (clean biotech cosmetics, $650 M valuation)
- Executive Producer, Aurora Pictures (focus: genre-bending musical dramas); UN Foundation Goodwill Ambassador for mental-health advocacy
- Pioneer of large-scale mixed-reality concerts (Chromatica Holo-Tour grossed $410 M, 2024)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing 8th studio album “Stardust Manifesto” — concept: “music engineered for extraterrestrial acoustics,” release Q3 2026
- Negotiating lunar-orbit performance tethered to Axiom/SpaceX tourist module (target 2028), using ultrasonic vibration suits to “feel” bass in micro-gravity
- Scaling Haus Labs’ bio-pigment line leveraging algae grown in closed-loop space habitats; seeking cross-licensing with aerospace food-grade materials
- Personally focused on chronic-pain mitigation through low-gravity physiotherapy; trialing NASA-derived light therapy rigs at home

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Off-hours astrophotographer; owns a custom Leica wrapped in iridescent meteoritic alloy
- Collects vintage Italian sci-fi pulp—draws costuming inspiration from 1960s Futurismo illustrations
- Maxims: “Radical sincerity is the new shock,” and “Art without risk is maintenance.”
- Disarming small talk hook: she still solves New York Times Saturday crosswords in pen—claims it “rewires stage nerves”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Fits Planta’s theme as a boundary-pushing performer exploring social connection beyond Earth
- Actively hunting collaborators for multi-sensory “lunar dinner soundtrack” blending bone-conduction audio, aroma diffusers, and haptic tableware
- Wants to test interactive journaling prompts for mental-health app under altered circadian cycles of the Moon
- Brings celebrity draw, narrative flair, and a 150 M-follower spotlight to amplify the event’s cultural impact

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable intros: Axiom Space mission planners; MIT Media Lab’s Tangible Media Group; MoMA curator Paola Antonelli (for potential exhibition of lunar artifacts)
- Attendees can help by sharing data on human taste perception in low gravity and offering beta access to neuro-adaptive audio tech
- Engagement tip: Ask what sonic frequencies she’s embedding in “Track 7—Tidal Hearts” to counter lunar silence; segues into her fascination with Schumann resonances

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Travel approvals contingent on real-time medical telemetry feed; discreetly confirm lunar base’s on-site physiotherapy options
- Prefers intimate conversation corners over center-stage mingling; bring a surprising fact first—she loves trading secrets
- Follow-up query: status of her planned “zero-gravity string quartet” and whether she needs on-site rehearsal space during the 2027 dinner
