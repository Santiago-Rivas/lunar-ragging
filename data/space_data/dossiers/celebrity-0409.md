### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Commissioned by Planta to craft a 90-second lunar-debut poem; wants acoustic feedback on recitation inside pressurized dome  
- Searching for collaborators who can translate spoken-word vibrations into haptic feedback suits for deaf audiences  
- Brings global media magnetism—her reading could drive viral coverage and position the dinner as the “Apollo moment of culture”  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES

- Prefers concise questions that invite metaphor; dislikes being labeled “young” or “future” poet—she views herself in the present tense  
- Follow-up probe: what hidden historical text inspired the new collection’s title page (she enjoys revealing obscure references)
