### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Lupita Nyong’o

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: Williamsburg, Brooklyn & Kilifi, Kenya (family compound she quietly restored in 2024)
- Monthly loop: NYC → L.A. for studio meetings; London every quarter for West End projects; occasional retreats in Oaxaca for writing

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Academy Award–winning actor, producer, and children’s author
- Founder, Eba Productions – incubates African-diaspora genre stories for screen, stage, and immersive media
- UN Women Goodwill Ambassador; global face for wildlife conservation campaigns (Elephant Crisis Fund)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Executive-producing “Orion’s Daughters,” an Afrofuturist limited series green-lit by Netflix (shoots mid-2026 in South Africa & UAE Mars-sim habitat)
- Developing mixed-reality adaptation of her bestseller “Sulwe” with Meta’s Horizon Studios – pilot experience set for 2027
- Personal goal: earn PADI Master Freediver certification; uses breath-work to manage on-set stress and jet lag
- Seeking Kenyan-based STEM scholarships targeting young women; in talks with Safaricom for a $5 M endowment

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Obsessive about vintage botanical illustrations; keeps a travel-size watercolor set, sketches plants during downtime
- Belief: “Storytelling is cultural infrastructure—if we don’t build it, someone else will.”
- Practices rhythmic drumming meditation learned from the Luo community; offers impromptu sessions to calm anxious casts
- Culinary curiosity: experiments with fermenting indigenous grains (sorghum, teff) into space-stable snacks

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence reinforces Planta’s vision of inclusive, artistic exploration of off-world living
- Actively scouting VR/AR engineers who can translate Moon-gravity movement into narrative choreography for “Orion’s Daughters”
- Curious about closed-loop agronomy on the Moon—possible tie-in to her fermentation research for sustainable craft foods
- Can lend global spotlight through social channels (10 M+ combined followers) and short-form documentary footage for National Geographic

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX UX team (lunar habitat ergonomics), Chef Dominique Crenn (plant-forward Michelin mentor), Google’s XR Labs (gesture-mapping in low-gravity)
- Attendees can assist by sharing prototype haptic suits or AI-driven set-design tools adaptable to lunar architecture
- Engage her with a brief, hands-on demo—she prefers tactile learning over slide decks; invite her to sketch lunar flora concepts on an e-ink tablet during cocktails

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Protect quiet moments—she recharges in 15-minute silent intervals; provide a low-traffic observation dome
- Avoid cliché compliments about “Black Panther”; pivot to her lesser-known Tony-nominated stage work (“Eclipsed”)
- Suggested opening question aligned with host’s goal: “What’s a talent you’ve cultivated that film audiences never see?” (she’ll likely reveal her competitive freediving stats or botanical art portfolio)
