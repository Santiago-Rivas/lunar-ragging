- Interested in how low-gravity habitats manage closed-loop ecosystems—parallels to Instituto Terra’s biodiversity corridors  
- Seeks conversations on spatial computing tools that can translate his still imagery into multi-sensorial installations  
- Brings gravitas around environmental storytelling, giving the event an ethical and planetary subtext the media will amplify

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: Patagonia Purpose Trust, Bezos Earth Fund, and SpaceX civil-science liaison for potential Earth-observation residency  
- Attendees can assist by sharing VR/AR pipelines, multi-spectral imaging tech, and philanthropic channels aimed at climate resilience  
- Best engagement approach: invite him to a quiet corner with panoramic Earth view; ask about the emotional aftermath of prolonged jungle immersion
