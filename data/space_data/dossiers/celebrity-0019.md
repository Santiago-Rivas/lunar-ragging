### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Hayao Miyazaki

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Koganei, Tokyo – lives within walking distance of Studio Ghibli
- Retreat pattern: monthly solo trips to Yakushima’s ancient cedar forests; annual seaside visit to Kagoshima for sketching aircraft
- Rarely attends overseas functions; agreed to the lunar dinner chiefly for its once-in-history narrative potential

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & Creative Director, Studio Ghibli (est. 1985)
- Academy Award: Best Animated Feature (Spirited Away); Honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement
- Revered globally for hand-drawn films blending ecological reverence, pacifism, and flight

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Incubating a new short film series “Weightless Dreams” designed for zero-gravity projection domes (prototypes with JAXA + NHK)
- Leading digital preservation of 40+ years of sketches—digitizing on archival washi to fund a children-run animation school
- Personal project: cultivating rooftop permaculture garden atop Ghibli Museum, experimenting with lunar-soil simulant for educational exhibits
- Health focus: daily 5 km walks; doctor-mandated reduction in cigarette intake before 2027 launch

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate model-airplane builder; keeps a 1:12 replica of the Caproni Ca.309 on his desk
- Collects early 20th-century botanical notebooks; fascinated by how illustrators conveyed texture without color
- Guiding axiom: “If a story can breathe, it can teach.” Believes environments are uncredited protagonists
- Surprising tidbit: secretly maintains a handwritten fantasy cookbook—recipes imagined from each fictional world he’s created

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as live research: studying body language and emotional tone in low-gravity for “Weightless Dreams”
- Searching for sensory designers who can translate aromas and sound in thin-pressure habitats
- Expected to doodle on the spot; will gift quick ink sketches to conversation partners who spark genuine curiosity
- Offers narrative-world-building frameworks to Planta Network for future off-Earth social gatherings

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: lunar horticulture experts (link to his soil-simulant garden), immersive audio engineers, Michelin-level space-culinary teams
- Attendees can help by sharing childhood moon-fantasies—he mines authentic memories for character nuance
- Engage him with a simple sketchbook of black paper and white pencils; ask how a child might play hide-and-seek in one-sixth gravity

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers conversational Japanese with concise English translation; avoid over-technical jargon
- Politely deflects franchise or merchandising pitches; focus on story, craft, and ecological stewardship
- Follow-up question for deeper rapport: “What ingredient from your secret fantasy cookbook would you serve in lunar gravity, and why?”
