### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Maria Popova  

---  
### IDENTITY & BASE  
- Primary base: Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY  
- Seasonal retreats in Santa Fe desert (April) and Maine coastline (September) for deep-work cycles  
- Routinely stacks international keynotes (Oxford, Melbourne Writers Festival, Caltech) into 10-day sprint trips to minimize travel-carbon footprint  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW  
- Founder & Editor, The Marginalian (formerly Brain Pickings) ‑- weekly readership 1.5 M+; UNESCO “Global Digital Heritage” honoree  
- Author, “Figuring” (NYT bestseller, 26 languages) and forthcoming essay collection “Constellations of Wonder” (Knopf, Oct 2026)  
- Curator-at-Large, Academy of American Poets; board member, Universe in Verse live-poetry initiative  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES  
- Final edits and illustration clearances for “Constellations of Wonder” – an interlaced history of awe from Sappho to Vera Rubin  
- Prototyping an AI-assisted “marginalia recommender” to surface interdisciplinary reading pathways for educators  
- Personal quest: completing a private pilot license to experience “the overview effect” firsthand before 2027 book tour  
- Building a micro-grant program for underrepresented science-and-art storytellers (launch target Q1 2026)  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS  
- Dawn cyclist, logs predawn rides across the Brooklyn Bridge to watch sunrises—calls it her “daily cosmic calibration”  
- Collects Victorian cyanotypes of algae; claims they remind her that “humility begins at the bottom of the ocean”  
- Guiding maxim: “Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity” (Simone Weil) – governs both her writing and social interactions  
- Keeps a pocket notebook of oddly beautiful words in dying languages; happy to trade favorites over dinner  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION  
- Resonates with the lunar venue’s invitation to adopt a cosmic vantage—directly aligns with her brand of “existential enchantment”  
- Curious to discuss how off-world habitats might cultivate culture, libraries, and shared mythologies, not just engineering feats  
- Seeks stories and data for a 2027 Marginalian series on “Hospitality Beyond Earth” – willing to feature participant insights  
- Brings cross-disciplinary reach: can amplify the event to 2 M engaged readers and a network of educators hungry for space-humanities content  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES  
- Warm introductions desired to:  
  • Dr. Sian Proctor (Inspiration4) – for pilot-perspective essays  
  • IKEA Space10 leads – to explore design grants for lunar public spaces  
  • Any chefs experimenting with closed-loop food systems (possible Marginalian feature)  
- Attendees can assist by sharing annotated reading lists or archival material on lunar cultural history  
- Engaging approach: offer a quiet corner conversation, reference an obscure poem about the Moon, and ask what it evokes—she thrives on specificity  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES  
- Surprising detail for the conversation prompt: She once served as an uncredited lyric translator on a Bulgarian folk-electronica album that charted in Japan  
- Prefers low-light environments; harsh LEDs trigger migraines—seat accordingly in the dome  
- Avoid corporate “content strategy” jargon; she disengages when writing is reduced to “monetization funnels”  
- Follow-up questions worth probing: status of her micro-grant endowment partners; how the AI recommender balances serendipity vs. surveillance
