**FULL NAME:** Harrison Ford

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: 800-acre ranch in Jackson, WY and a discreet compound in Brentwood, Los Angeles  
- Regular cockpit hours flying his Cessna CJ4 between LA, Wyoming, DC, and short humanitarian hops in the Caribbean  
- Accepts “one long-haul” international shoot per year; recent pattern is London or Sydney for studio work, then immediate return to Wyoming for recovery  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Legendary actor-producer (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Blade Runner); lifetime global box-office > $10 B  
- Founder, Black Bear Aviation Media – boutique banner producing conservation & aviation documentaries  
- Vice-Chair, Conservation International; UN Environment Goodwill Ambassador; FAA-rated fixed-wing & helicopter pilot  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Packaging “Anthropocene Frontlines,” a six-part docuseries spotlighting climate-tech innovators; shopping to streamers before end-Q3 2025  
- Retrofitting his CJ4 to run 100 % Sustainable Aviation Fuel and documenting the process as a carbon-reduction case study  
- Undergoing commercial-spaceflight medical certification; target suborbital flight by mid-2026 to gather Earth-observation content for CI  
- Personally mentoring two young Native American filmmakers from Wind River Reservation on storytelling and aerial cinematography  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong woodworker; still mills his own walnut for custom fly-fishing cabinets—great icebreaker  
- Amateur astrophotographer; sets up an 8-inch refractor on clear Wyoming nights to capture Orion Nebula timelapses  
- Guiding maxim: “Real adventure starts when the plan stops working”—values pragmatic problem-solvers over polished talkers  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Celebrity gravity will multiply press reach of Planta’s lunar showcase and help normalize “off-world hospitality” narratives  
- Intrigued by psychological parallels between solo aviation and lunar habitation; wants to compare stress-mitigation protocols  
- Looking for tech partners who can stream ultra-high-res Earth imagery from the Moon for conservation storytelling  
- Can contribute a short narrated segment for the post-event documentary, lending instant cultural resonance  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros sought: Planet Labs sustainability group, NatGeo EVP of Original Content, SpaceX Starshield Earth-observation lead  
- Attendees with VR-simulation or haptic UX expertise could aid his docuseries’ immersive companion app  
- Engage him by inviting a walkthrough of the base’s cockpit-styled control deck; ask his opinion on human-machine interface tweaks—he will offer detailed, pilot-centric feedback  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Moderate hearing loss in left ear—speak on his right side in noisy environments  
- Prefers intimate, table-side dialogue over large panels; time boxing (≤10 min) is appreciated  
- Follow-up queries: confirm availability for a VO session in Feb 2026; gauge interest in serving on Planta’s Advisory Council for Human Experience in Space
