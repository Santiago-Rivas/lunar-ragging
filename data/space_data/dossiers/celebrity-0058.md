**FULL NAME:** Chris Martin

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Hampstead, London  
- Secondary hubs: Malibu (recording retreat) & Cape Town (philanthropic projects)  
- Pattern: 6-week blocks on tour, followed by silent-week digital detox in rural locales; never travels without acoustic-analysis kit for impromptu venue tests  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder, lead vocalist & creative director, Coldplay (100M+ albums sold)  
- Architect of the band’s “Music of the Spheres” carbon-negative tour model; consulting with Live Nation on industry-wide adoption  
- Co-investor in HoloSound, an AR/VR audio startup mapping 3-D soundscapes for extraterrestrial venues  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Recording Coldplay’s final studio album (working title: “Moonflowers”), slated for Q3 2026 release  
- Partnering with ESA acousticians to prototype low-gravity performance rigs; eyeing a micro-concert on the lunar south pole in 2028  
- Personal focus: mastering ceramic wheel-throwing as a mindfulness discipline; aims to auction lunar-inspired pottery for Global Citizen campaigns  
- Expanding “Road to Regeneration” initiative—reforestation + ocean-plastic removal tied to concert ticketing  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Daily Vedic meditation; carries a pocket harmonium for pre-show centering  
- Collects 19th-century celestial maps—claims they “remind me humans have always been a bit space-obsessed”  
- Guiding belief: “Art should leave the planet kinder than it found it.”  
- Surprising fact: quietly completed an astrophysics certification through MITx during lockdown; can calculate orbital transfer windows in his head  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence signals culture-meets-space crossover credibility for Planta’s showcase  
- Seeking dialogue on: acoustic dampening in regolith structures, carbon offsets for off-planet events, and multi-sensory dining scores (soundtracks paired to flavor profiles)  
- Can provide: celebrity spotlight, curated performance snippet, and access to Coldplay’s sustainability advisors for Planta’s future out-of-Earth activations  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to:  
  • Blue Origin’s orbital habitats team (stage logistics)  
  • Patagonia’s “Earth Tax” fund (joint climate-space initiatives)  
- Open to mentoring indie musicians attending the dinner, especially those experimenting with spatial audio tech  
- Best engagement approach: invite him to co-design a “lunar sound bath” during dessert—hands-on collaboration over passive Q&A ignites his creativity  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Alcohol-free; prefers herbal tea—ensure non-alcoholic pairings are highlighted  
- Keep conversation devices-light; he values eye contact and analog instruments  
- Follow-up after event: share VR audio renderings of the dinner’s ambiance for potential integration into Coldplay’s 2027 tour interludes
