**FULL NAME:** Brian Armstrong

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: San Francisco, CA  
- Maintains townhouse in Washington, DC for policy work; frequent circuits to Austin, Singapore, and London every quarter  
- “Digital nomad weeks” twice a year—rotates to crypto-friendly jurisdictions (latest: Dubai + Lisbon) to keep pulse on global regulatory climates  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-Founder & CEO, Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) – 110 M+ verified users; $150 B+ quarterly trading volume  
- Co-Founder & Executive Chairman, NewLimit (cellular reprogramming for longevity)  
- Founder, ResearchHub (open-access science platform)  
- Landmark achievements  
  • Drove first major U.S. crypto IPO (2021)  
  • Spearheaded “Base,” one of the fastest-growing Ethereum L2 ecosystems (2024-25)  
  • Personally donated $200 M+ to pro-innovation political action, scientific research, and global basic-income pilots  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Securing MiCA-ready European derivatives expansion by Q4 2025; aim: $10 B monthly volumes on Coinbase International  
- Scaling Base to host “1 M on-chain apps” by 2026; incentives pool earmarked at $500 M  
- NewLimit’s first human safety trial slated for early 2026—actively courting crossover biotech funds and moonshot philanthropists  
- Personal 2025-26 quest: log 100 hours as a private pilot; planning near-orbital suborbital qualification by end-2026  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Practices 10-day silent Vipassana retreats; credits meditation for major product decisions  
- Lifelong drummer—keeps an electronic kit in his home office; open to spontaneous jam sessions  
- Guiding maxim: “Clear rules, open participation, global equality.” Sees blockchain as “the freedom layer of the internet.”  
- Surprising fact (conversation gold): at age 19, lived cash-only in Buenos Aires for six months to understand inflation firsthand—carries that tattered 10-billon-peso note in his wallet as a reminder  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Moon Dinner as proof-of-concept for off-world economies; curious about settlement governance and autonomous supply chains  
- Wants dialogue on trustless micropayments for extraterrestrial habitats—envisions using Base to settle local lunar transactions with <1-cent gas fees  
- Could contribute frameworks for tokenizing lunar real estate rights and funding communal infrastructure via DAOs  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros sought to:  
  • NASA’s Artemis Commercial Partnerships lead  
  • SpaceX Starship life-support R&D team  
  • Sovereign Wealth Funds eyeing space resources (e.g., Saudi, UAE)  
- Attendees can help by sharing edge-case latency data (Earth-Moon round-trip ~1.3 s) to stress-test on-chain settlement protocols  
- Engage him with evidence-backed moon-habitat sustainability challenges; offer a quick walk-through of any VR design mock-ups  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers crisp, metrics-driven exchange; four-minute “lightning whiteboards” over formal pitch decks  
- Sensitive topic: Media scrutiny over Coinbase compliance layoffs—frame regulatory talk around solutions, not blame  
- Follow-up Q’s worth asking: status of his suborbital pilot license; whether Base’s “celestia rollups” roadmap is green-lit for 2026 launch
