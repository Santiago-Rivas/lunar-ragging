### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Stan Wawrinka

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Lausanne, Switzerland; maintains a residence in Monte Carlo for European training blocks
- Regular travel loop: Zurich → Dubai → New York for exhibition matches, sports-tech summits, and investor meetings
- Newly added stops: Houston (Johnson Space Center sessions on human performance in micro-g) and Tokyo (recovery-tech R&D partners)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Three-time Grand Slam champion; Olympic doubles gold medalist (2008) and 2014 Davis Cup winner
- Transitioned from full-time ATP Tour in 2024 to athlete-investor/mentor role
- Co-founder & Chair, Rebound Analytics AG – AI-driven motion-capture wearables optimizing stroke mechanics and injury prevention
- Board advisor, Swiss Space Center’s “Sport Beyond Earth” initiative

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a €25 M Series B for Rebound Analytics; targeting space-grade sensors for low-gravity sport applications
- Building the Wawrinka Performance Lab outside Lausanne—hybrid facility for elite tennis, cognitive science, and virtual reality training
- Authoring “Backhand to the Stars,” a memoir-plus-future-spec book slated for late 2026 release
- Personal goal: photograph Earthrise with a medium-format camera during lunar visit and auction prints for UNICEF mental-health programs

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Astrophotography geek; owns a custom-modified Hasselblad 907X
- Collects vintage mechanical watches, favoring independent Swiss makers experimenting with materials used in spacecraft
- Guiding philosophy tattooed on his arm: “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail Again. Fail Better.” (Samuel Beckett)
- Enjoys molecular gastronomy—last post-match splurge was a 14-course sensory menu at Disfrutar, Barcelona

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending to evaluate human-movement constraints inside lunar habitats and to test sensor prototypes in 1/6 g
- Seeking dialogue with space architects, materials scientists, and experiential chefs on designing the first zero-gravity tennis exhibition in 2027
- Offers charismatic storytelling on resilience and precision—ideal keynote-style soundbites for Planta’s media capture
- Surprising talking-point prompt: he crafts his own analog film emulsions from Swiss alpine minerals

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: Axiom Space flight-crew operations team; SpaceX Starship life-support engineers; chef Grant Achatz (for gastro-collab on micro-g plating)
- Asks the host for help identifying VR creators who can simulate lunar-court physics for public demos
- Engagement tips: open with photography or watchmaking rather than tennis; share a personal “first time I failed spectacularly” anecdote—he’ll reciprocate

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers direct, no-fluff exchanges; dislikes comparisons to Federer—focus on his independent path
- Sensitive topic: knee surgeries—respect his timeline but can discuss data-driven rehab if relevant
- Follow-up questions: status of flight seat allocation for his sensor-payload, and whether Planta’s platform can live-stream a one-handed backhand in lunar gravity
