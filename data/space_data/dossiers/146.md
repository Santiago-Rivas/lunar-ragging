- Credited with modernizing on-screen martial arts by merging traditional Wing Chun and MMA with motion-capture and AI-enhanced choreography

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Preparing to helm and star in “Gravity Blade,” a sci-fi action epic set on a lunar colony (pre-production; seeking strategic tech partners)
- Building a proprietary stunt-simulation platform using Unreal Engine and haptic suits to reduce on-set risk
- Personal goal: pivot into impact investing—funds earmarked for health-tech startups addressing fighter rehabilitation and cognitive longevity

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Classical pianist; practices Liszt for hand-speed discipline—rarely publicized
- Collector of vintage NASA mission patches, fascinated by the parallels between spaceflight discipline and martial-arts mastery
- Guiding maxim: “Control is earned in breath, not in muscle.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- The lunar dinner backdrop dovetails with “Gravity Blade” marketing and authenticity research; eager to experience real low-gravity movement

- Brings star power for media amplification; willing to shoot a short behind-the-scenes vignette on location for Planta’s channels

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX & Blue Origin experiential teams; Dolby Laboratories for spatial-audio capture; elite chefs exploring molecular cuisine for on-set nutrition
- Attendees can assist by sharing biometric feedback tech for stunt performance, or lunar surface lighting solutions
- Engage him with a quick demo of Planta’s social-sensor wristbands—compare their data with his fight-camp wearables; segue into stress-response optimization

### ADDITIONAL NOTES

- Potential follow-up: explore cameo by Planta’s AI avatars in “Gravity Blade” end-credits scene
