### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Bryan Johnson

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Venice Beach, Los Angeles; maintains R&D suite in Salt Lake City
- Routinely city-hops between Bay Area, Boston, and London for neurotech, synthetic biology, and longevity summits
- Predictable pattern: two weeks on-site with Kernel engineers, one week of “Blueprint travel mode” testing biomarkers in varying environments

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Kernel – non-invasive brain-interface company shifting from research devices to real-time neural analytics APIs
- Managing Partner, OS Fund II ($650 M under management) – backs frontier science ventures in genomic programming, molecular manufacturing, and planetary resilience
- Previous exit: Braintree/Venmo sale to PayPal for $800 M (2013); Forbes “100 Greatest Living Business Minds”

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing strategic partnership with a major headset maker to embed Kernel flow-state metrics into consumer AR
- Expanding “Blueprint” longevity protocol into a subscription data platform; aims to publish first 1,000-person cohort outcomes by Q4 2025
- Personal moonshot: demonstrate that continuous biological self-measurement can compress 20 years of health research into 24 months
- Exploring microgravity studies on neurovascular coupling—earmarks $10 M for an orbital trial if a suitable partner emerges

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Evening pianist; composes minimalist pieces to specific heart-rate variability targets
- Fascinated by Stoic philosophy—keeps a pocket edition of Epictetus, quotes “First, say to yourself what you would be; then do what you have to do”
- Enjoys provocative questions; recently asked dinner guests to calculate “the ROI of awe” in their lives

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees The First Dinner Party on the Moon as a live laboratory for social neurodynamics in reduced gravity
- Wants candid dialogue on how sensory design (light spectra, aroma, acoustics) affects emotional coherence among guests
- Will share Kernel’s latest “instant empathy” biofeedback demo—portable headset that visualizes conversational synchrony in AR
- Open to co-investing in lunar habitation tech that measurably improves cognitive performance

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX Starship life-support leads; MIT Media Lab’s Space Exploration Initiative; DeepMind’s neuro-RL group
- Attendees can help by offering unique physiological datasets collected in extreme environments
- Best engagement: ask him to reveal a surprising metric he tracks daily (beyond the 100+ already public) and what it taught him about being human

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Media often caricature his anti-aging regimen; he appreciates questions framed around scientific curiosity rather than spectacle
- Sensitive: discreetly confirm whether Kernel’s FDA Breakthrough Device designation has been secured before referencing it publicly
- Follow-up probe: interest level in sponsoring a longitudinal “lunar cohort” of 12 participants wearing Kernel gear for a full lunar day-night cycle
