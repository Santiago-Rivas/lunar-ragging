### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Björn Borg

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Värmdö archipelago outside Stockholm; secondary apartment in Monte Carlo for tax and tennis circuit access
- Predictable travel loop: Stockholm ⇄ Paris (Björn Borg AB HQ & fashion weeks) ⇄ New York (brand flagship + US Open celebrity events)
- Rarely seen on standard conference circuits; prefers intimate, purpose-driven gatherings

- Five-time Wimbledon champion; enduring icon for mental composure under extreme pressure

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Rolling out “LunaLine” smart performance wear (graphene & basalt fiber blends licensed from ESA spin-offs) targeting Asia-Pacific launch Q3 2026
- Incubating a digital “Match Point Mind” academy: immersive VR modules teaching Borg’s breathing routines and focus rituals to Gen Z athletes
- Personal goal: secure one more 250 km ultra-cycling race finish before age 70; rigorous biomechanics program underway
- Exploring philanthropic vehicle to fund Scandinavian youth sport programs emphasizing mental health

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Relaxes by building miniature wooden sailboats—precision hobby echoing his touch-centric tennis style
- Lifelong fascination with space exploration since meeting Swedish astronaut Christer Fuglesang; keeps signed ISS patch in his office

- Enjoys discussing the parallels between lunar low-gravity movement and clay-court footwork dynamics

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as proof-of-concept for off-planet leisure—ideal testbed for LunaLine garments in micro-dust environments
- Looking to meet material scientists, micro-gravity physiologists, and storytellers who can weave performance wear into frontier narratives
- Offers decades-deep insight on sustaining elite focus amid unprecedented spectacle—valuable for Planta’s “human connection” thesis

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to:
  • Dr. Y. Nakamura, JAXA textile innovations lead  
  • Artemis Hospitality Fund partners exploring lunar tourism  
  • MetaHolo Studios for VR academy content co-development
- Attendees can assist by sharing data on sweat evaporation and muscle recovery in 1/6 g; invites collaboration on pilot testing
- Engage him with precise questions about mental routines or material performance—not generic tennis nostalgia

### ADDITIONAL NOTES

- Knees surgically repaired 2022; avoids uneven terrain—arrange seated, low-gravity “walk-through” during base tour
- Follow-up queries: gauge interest in joining Planta’s advisory board on human performance; ask whether IcePulse is seeking Series A co-investors
