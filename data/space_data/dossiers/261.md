- Building a $20 M endowment for the Foundation to open satellite academies in West Africa and the U.S. Rust Belt  
- Personal curiosity in low-gravity athletic performance; quietly sponsoring a University of Colorado study on muscle-fiber adaptation in lunar simulations  
- Exploring strategic angel investments in immersive training tech (haptics, mixed-reality coaching)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate sneakerhead: owns 400-pair archive, designs limited drops for charity auctions  
- Loves spoken-word poetry; performs under the alias “FT Lines” at unadvertised open-mic nights  
- Guiding maxim: “Joy is a tactic.” Believes visible enthusiasm disarms opponents and unlocks collaboration  
- Unusual fact prompt: can solve a Rubik’s Cube in under 90 seconds—learned during 2020 tour shutdown

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a test case for human performance and social bonding in space environments  
- Wants dialogue on: (1) adaptive athletics in micro-gravity, (2) VR/AR pipelines that make elite coaching accessible to kids with no courts, (3) storytelling that reframes sport as global unifier beyond Earth  
- Offers celebrity reach and media pull to amplify Planta’s lunar narrative to Gen Z audiences

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable intros:  
  • Dr. Mei Tan (Caltech low-g physiology) – potential research collaborator  
  • Andreessen Sports Tech Fund partners – next funding round for Foundation-backed startups  
  • Chef Kwame Onwuachi – exploring “diaspora-in-space” culinary content series  
- Ways attendees can help: share insights on sustainable habitat design suitable for recreational sport; provide contacts in emerging-market telecoms for VR streaming bandwidth  
- Engagement tips: open with the cube challenge or ask which sneaker silhouette he’d redesign for lunar dust—immediately energizes him

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers candid, humor-laced conversation over formal pitches; responds well to stories of overcoming odds  
- Sensitive: avoids deep discussion of parents’ early financial struggles unless he raises it first  
- Follow-up question to explore: interest in hosting the first zero-gravity charity tennis rally aboard an orbital station—would Planta Network film and distribute?
