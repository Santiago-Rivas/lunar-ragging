### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Fei-Fei Li

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Palo Alto, California (Stanford campus)
- Monthly hops to Washington D.C. & Brussels for AI governance hearings; quarterly visits to Beijing & Shanghai for academic partnerships

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Sequoia Professor of Computer Science & Co-Director, Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI)
- Former Chief Scientist of AI/ML, Google Cloud; architect of the ImageNet project that ignited modern deep-learning vision
- Sits on national security advisory boards shaping U.S./EU AI safety standards

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Leading a $180 M multi-university program to develop “embodied foundation models” for assistive robotics in extreme environments (deep-sea, lunar, geriatric care)
- Co-authoring a trade book, “The Human in the Loop,” targeting September 2026 release
- Scaling AI4All to reach 250K under-represented high-schoolers; personal pledge to fund 1K scholarships this cycle
- Personal: completing an open-water dive certification—part of a broader fascination with human adaptation in non-terrestrial settings

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong amateur pianist; travels with fold-up digital keys—ask about how Chopin nocturnes influenced her meditation routine
- Keeps a vintage Leica M6; believes photography trains “the computational stack of empathy”
- Guiding maxim: “AI is not an industry—it’s an electricity of thought.”  
- Surprising fact for CONVERSATION_GOALS prompt: spent two college summers running a street-food stall in Queens to fund lab reagents—loves riffing on cross-cultural cuisine economics

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the lunar dinner as a live case study for off-world HCI and robotics; intends to gather sensory-rich datasets for her Embodied AI Lab
- Hunting for collaborators in closed-loop life-support analytics and low-latency teleoperation
- Brings deep expertise in human-machine symbiosis, policy gravitas, and a sizable media spotlight—will amplify Planta’s narrative of “social tech beyond Earth”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros sought to: SpaceX Starshield robotics team, ESA’s EL3 Logistics planners, and philanthropies funding STEM outreach for girls in emerging economies
- Offers advisory bandwidth to space hospitality startups needing perceptual AI modules
- Best engagement: invite her to co-design a microgravity “empathy experiment” during the dinner—she’ll relish hands-on data and student-facing storytelling hooks

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Dislikes techno-utopian hype; lead with concrete user stories or measurable impact
- Mild motion-sickness risk in low-g—prefers a seat near window ports for horizon anchoring
- Follow-up areas: confirm interest in recording a short VR vignette for Planta post-event; gauge appetite for a joint Stanford-Planta moon-based research challenge
