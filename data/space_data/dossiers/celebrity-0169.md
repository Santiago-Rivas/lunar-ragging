### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Virgil van Dijk

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Formby (Merseyside, UK); keeps an apartment in Rotterdam for national-team camps  
- Regular monthly hops to Dubai & Los Angeles for recovery technology demos and brand meetings  
- Known for booking “red-eye, red-zone” trips that minimize public exposure and maximize physio hours  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Club Captain & Centre-Back, Liverpool FC; Captain, Netherlands Men’s National Team  
- Brand partner: Nike, EA Sports, JBL, and recently Panasonic’s athlete-grade VR system  
- Only defender to win UEFA Men’s Player of the Year (2019) and still holds top-5 all-time Premier League passing accuracy  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Extending playing peak to 2028 through data-driven load management and lunar-gravity cross-training experiments  
- Building VV8 Capital, an early-stage fund for injury-prevention biotech and immersive fan engagement platforms (first close targeted Q1 2026)  
- Co-developing a kids’ mental-resilience app with UNICEF Netherlands; pilot launches September 2025  
- Personal ambition: qualify for a private pilot license—aims to fly teammates to Euro 2028 qualifiers  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hidden pastime: produces ambient “space-echo” tracks under alias “Oranje Static” (releases on SoundCloud every solstice)  
- Chess evangelist; travels with a pocket magnetic board—uses Sicilian Defense to relax pre-match  
- Guiding credo: “Composure creates space.” Believes calm decision-making translates from back-line defense to business boards  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending to study low-gravity motor-skill adaptation for elite athletes; keen on in-situ demos with Planta’s haptic rigs  
- Looking to meet food scientists exploring omega-3-rich micro-greens grown in lunar habitats for joint health research  
- Brings global spotlight and 60 M social followers—valuable amplification for Planta’s lunar narrative  
- Prepared to offer post-event testimonial and VR capture of a penalty-kick sequence inside the habitat for marketing collateral  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros sought to:  
  • SpaceX life-science team (bone-density tech)  
  • Netflix Sports Originals—interest in docuseries “Defending in Zero G”  
  • Singapore Sovereign Fund reps eyeing sports-tech co-investment in VV8 Capital  
- Ideal engagement: invite him to test the low-gravity treadmill, then segue into a brief track-side chat about music production—strikes both athletic and personal chords  
- Offer to connect him with on-site astrophotographer for a moon-surface album cover shot (fits his secret music persona)  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers concise, quietly confident interaction; ignores excessive flattery  
- Avoid discussing 2023 ACL scare—focus on forward-looking recovery tech instead  
- Follow-up queries:  
  • Status of VV8 Capital’s cornerstone LPs; open ticket size?  
  • Would he host a post-Euro 2028 charity match streamed via Planta’s social VR platform?
