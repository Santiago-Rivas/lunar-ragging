### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Bryan Adams

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: London (Chelsea); secondary studio loft in Vancouver’s Gastown
- Predictable travel loop: Europe → North America → Asia on 90-day cycles tied to tour legs and photo commissions
- Adds brief retreat blocks in Mustique for songwriting privacy

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Grammy-winning singer-songwriter (100 M+ records sold) and acclaimed portrait photographer
- Composer/lyricist for Broadway & West End musicals (Pretty Woman, upcoming “Clearing Skies” debuting 2026)
- Philanthropic founder, Bryan Adams Foundation—focus on education, climate resilience, anti-animal cruelty

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Recording 17th studio album “Lunar Echoes,” experimenting with Dolby Atmos and low-frequency resonance for off-planet playback
- Planning 40th-anniversary “Reckless Re-Ignited” world tour (2025-26) with carbon-negative production powered by green hydrogen rigs
- Building equity stake in two EU startups: one prints plant-based biopolymer guitar picks; the other develops oxygen-generating algae tiles for spacecraft cabins
- Curating photo book “Eyes on Earth” (2026) documenting climate innovators; proceeds earmarked for Pacific reef restoration

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong vegan; fascinated by haute cuisine that survives beyond Earth’s biosphere—keen to taste lunar-grown microgreens
- Collects vintage Leica rangefinders; shoots exclusively on Ilford black-and-white for personal work
- Philosophy: “If you’re not pushing boundaries, you’re standing still.” Comfortable being the first to test ideas in public
- Secret quirk: designs guitar straps from recycled aircraft seatbelts—a hobby that began during pandemic downtime

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to EVENT as potential pilot site for the first commercially streamed lunar acoustic performance
- Wants dialogue with space acousticians on resonance in 1/6 g and reduced air pressure chambers
- Open to gifting a limited-edition lunar-session single to Planta Network’s community archive
- Brings marketing firepower: 6.2 M Instagram followers, cross-platform reach > 20 M for post-event amplification

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX Starship life-support engineers, Sony Music metaverse labs, Impossible Foods R&D (for cosmic cuisine co-branding)
- Needs supplier of ultra-light fiber cabling for on-surface stage rigs; could source through attending aerospace vendors
- Best engagement: invite him to photograph the prep kitchen, then segue into tasting panel—combines two passions and yields social-ready content

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers conversational, first-name addresses; low tolerance for corporate jargon
- Hearing protection is essential—mild tinnitus; avoid loud ambient demos without warning
- Follow-up questions:  
  1. Confirm IP ownership terms for lunar performance recording.  
  2. Gauge willingness to auction lunar guitar for charity tie-in to COP 32.  
  3. Ask what personal memento he plans to leave on the Moon—could become a storytelling jewel.
