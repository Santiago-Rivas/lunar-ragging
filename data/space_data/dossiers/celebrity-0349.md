### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jeff Dean

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Palo Alto, CA
- Maintains pied-à-terre in Seattle for family ties; quarterly stays in Zürich to sync with Google DeepMind’s European research hubs
- Routinely logs 250k+ airline miles/year; favors red-eye flights to preserve daylight coding hours

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Senior Fellow & Chief Scientist, Google DeepMind; de-facto architect of Alphabet’s long-horizon AI research agenda
- Co-creator of MapReduce, Bigtable, TensorFlow; leads internal “Gemini” multimodal foundation-model program
- IEEE John von Neumann Medal, ACM Prize in Computing, and 250+ patents / papers shaping modern distributed systems

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling next-gen transformer-mixture models to trillion-parameter range while reducing training energy by 40%
- Spearheading “AI for Planetary Resilience” initiative—deploying adaptive models for wildfire prediction, coral reef monitoring, and low-orbit debris tracking
- Personally funding an open-source hardware incubator exploring photonic accelerators
- Marathon-ready again after micro-fracture recovery; intends sub-3-hour finish at 2026 Boston

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend passion: hand-tool woodworking; designed a maple-and-titanium standing desk that breaks down into carry-on luggage
- Collects pre-1970 mechanical calculators; claims debugging them sharpens intuition for computational bottlenecks
- Guiding maxim: “Systems should fail gracefully, not silently.”  Applies equally to code, organizations, and ecosystems
- Enjoys speculative fiction—cites Liu Cixin’s Remembrance trilogy for expanding his mental model of civilization-scale engineering

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Curious how low-gravity environments alter fluid dynamics in cooling stacks—relevant to space-based data centers he’s modeling
- Seeking informal dialogue on lunar governance frameworks; wants to embed ethical AI standards into early off-world charters
- Brings expertise in latency-tolerant networking and federated learning that could enable on-site edge AI for the lunar base
- Conversation hook matching host prompt: few know he once interned at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab writing code that flew on the Mars Pathfinder rover

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to: SpaceX Starshield compute team, ESA’s Moonlight optical-comms program, chefs experimenting with AI-optimized nutrition profiles
- Offers mentorship or office hours for founders building sustainable compute or planetary-science datasets
- Engage him during the aperitif course with a question about woodworking in 1/6 g—he’s sketched torque-adjusted hand plane concepts

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers technical depth over visionary platitudes; steer clear of generic “AI will save the world” language
- Politely evasive on Alphabet internal reorg chatter—avoid prying
- Follow-up queries: outcomes from his 2025 “Carbon-Aware Scheduling” pilot across Google data centers; interest in joint lunar-Earth ML benchmarks
