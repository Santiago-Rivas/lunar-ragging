### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jiro Ono

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Ginza, Tokyo – subterranean 10-seat counter Sukiyabashi Jiro  
- Rarely travels; makes dawn fish-market runs and annual pilgrimages to coastal suppliers in Hokkaido & Kyushu  
- Moon visit will be his first off-planet journey; travel cleared after recent low-gravity medical simulations in Tsukuba

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Head Chef, Sukiyabashi Jiro – first sushi restaurant awarded Michelin 3 ★ (2007); subject of worldwide-streaming documentary “Jiro Dreams of Sushi”  
- Mentor to >150 shokunin now leading elite counters across the globe  
- Advisor to Japan’s Agency for Marine-Ecology on sustainable tuna management

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing succession: eldest son Yoshikazu assumes day-to-day operations; Jiro now crafts limited “master flights” (10 nigiri sets per week) to preserve technique  
- R&D with Tokyo University on cultured bluefin otoro—aims for indistinguishable taste by 2026  
- Personal goal: plate the “perfect bite” in a location never touched by oceans, proving terroir of skill over geography  
- Health regimen: strict cycling on stationary bike, low-salt diet, weekly tai chi to maintain fingertip sensitivity

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects antique Japanese calligraphy brushes; practices kanji strokes to steady hands before every service  
- Believes “Simplicity is the reward of relentless subtraction” – his guiding maxim  
- Fascinated by how altered atmospheric pressure amplifies aroma compounds; keeps a notebook titled “Air vs Flavor”  
- Enjoys quiet conversations about craftsmanship in unrelated fields (watchmaking, violin lutherie)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Iconic culinary presence underscores Planta’s “uncommon commonalities” theme—traditional mastery meets lunar futurism  
- Keen to discuss: grain behavior in low-gravity rice polishing; umami perception when olfactory pathways change in reduced pressure  
- Seeking partners to scale closed-loop aquaculture for lunar & Martian colonies; needs data on energy inputs vs flavor output  
- Will perform a live micro-gravity nigiri demonstration using magnetized geta board and chilled cultured tuna

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value introductions: NASA Deep-Space Food Systems team, BlueNalu (cultured fish), and Kimbal Musk’s Lunar Greenhouse Initiative  
- Attendees can assist with sensor tech to monitor rice moisture in 1/6 g, or offer modular counters compatible with glove-assisted preparation  
- Meaningful engagement: ask what element of sushi craft would benefit most from zero-airborne bacteria, or share personal “first taste that changed everything”

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Age 100 in 2025; uses a discreet bone-conduction earpiece—speak clearly, moderate pace  
- Politely declines discussion of Michelin star loss after restaurant became invitation-only; focus on legacy and innovation instead  
- Follow-up Q: interest in establishing a lunar apprenticeship program so the first sushi made by a non-Earthborn chef carries his lineage
