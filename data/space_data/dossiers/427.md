### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chancellor, Pontifical Academy of Sciences & Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences (since 2022)

- Writing a memoir-essay collection, “Welded Faith,” linking his teenage apprenticeship as a metalworker to future lunar fabrication

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong jazz aficionado; keeps a well-worn Charlie Parker fake book in his briefcase—uses improv as a metaphor for synodality
- Enjoys tending a micro-garden of Ghanaian herbs on a Vatican rooftop; eager to compare notes on closed-loop lunar agronomy
- Guiding maxim: “Creation is not a warehouse of goods but a community of gifts.”
- Surprising fact (conversation prompt): still owns and occasionally rides a restored 1971 Suzuki 250 motorcycle stored at his brother’s farm in Cape Coast

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to offer an ethical framing of mankind’s first social gathering off-Earth and to observe Planta’s human-connection tech for a forthcoming Vatican symposium

- Can contribute historical perspective on faith–science collaboration plus a globally trusted moral voice that elevates media coverage

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to:  
  • SpaceX and Blue Origin sustainability leads  
  • African Union Space Council chair Dr. Tidiane Ouattara  
  • Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard (for ecological patronage)
- Attendees could assist by sharing data from lunar bioreactors, and by exploring co-funded scholarships for African students in astro-agriculture
- Engagement tips: open with jazz or metal-work anecdotes; invite his blessing for the meal; provide concise, actionable briefs—he dislikes abstract theorizing without pathways
