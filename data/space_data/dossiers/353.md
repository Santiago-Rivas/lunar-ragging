### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Yoshua Bengio

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Montréal, Québec; splits time between Mila HQ and Université de Montréal campus
- Regular circuits: Paris (Collège de France visiting chair), Geneva (UN AI advisory sessions), San Francisco & New York (policy roundtables)
- “Deep-work” retreats in the Laurentian forest each quarter to write and prototype new architectures

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Professor & Canada CIFAR AI Chair; Scientific Director, Mila (1,200-member deep-learning institute)
- Co-recipient, 2018 ACM Turing Award for pioneering modern deep learning
- Founder, Institut québécois d’intelligence artificielle pour le Climat (IQIAC) and Board member, Global Partnership on AI

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Advancing “GFlowNets” research—generative flow networks aimed at reasoning-capable AI beyond today’s transformers
- Launching a €150 M international consortium on robust AI alignment with EU Horizon funding (kick-off Q4 2025)
- Designing low-carbon training pipelines; target: 10× reduction in compute energy per model by 2027
- Personal: compiling a bilingual book of haiku inspired by neural dynamics; release slated for late 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend cross-country skier and amateur astrophotographer—owns a portable 8-inch scope for deep-sky imaging
- Collects vintage French sci-fi comics (Métal Hurlant era) and cites them as early inspiration for “thinking beyond Earth”
- Guiding maxim: “Intelligence without empathy is just optimization.”
- Enjoys asking dinner companions to imagine the moral code of a sentient machine born off-planet

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees lunar base as a living lab for aligned autonomous systems: habitat management, resource optimization, and psychological well-being
- Wants candid dialogue on creating a moon-based “constitutional AI charter” before commercial interests dominate
- Interested in chefs’ use of constrained resources—parallels his work on efficient AI
- Brings credibility and media gravity; his endorsement could frame Planta as an ethical tech leader

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to: SpaceX Starship life-support team, NASA Ames AI autonomy group, JAXA’s Smart Lander engineers
- Potential mentor pairing with early-stage founders building edge-AI chips hardened for radiation
- Engaging tactics: offer a quick VR walkthrough of Planta’s closed-loop social graph algorithms; invite him to brainstorm “moonshot” alignment experiments over dessert
- Provide data on greenhouse-gas offsets of the launch manifest—aligns with his climate focus

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers quiet, intellectually intense conversations—limit background music during the seven-minute chat
- Sensitive to hype: ground claims in concrete metrics
- Follow-up questions: (1) How can Mila collaborate on a lunar AI ethics framework? (2) Would he loan a sci-fi panel to the event’s art installation?
