### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Billy Joel

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Oyster Bay, Long Island, NY  
- Winter retreat: Palm Beach, FL marina residence  
- Regular shuttles to Manhattan for his Madison Square Garden residency (monthly through mid-2026)  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Legendary singer-songwriter, 160 M+ records sold; six-time Grammy winner  
- Ongoing “Piano Man Residency” at MSG (longest in history, slated to conclude July 2026)  
- Founder, Billy Joel Foundation—grants for music education & coastal conservation  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Preparing a farewell-style world tour with a grand finale simulcast from orbit or lunar surface (in talks with SpaceX Starlink Studios)  
- Negotiating a $400 M catalog sale while retaining creative control for future immersive formats (Dolby Atmos, Apple Vision Pro concerts)  
- Co-developing “PianoVerse,” an AI-driven interactive songwriting tool for schools; prototype launch Q4 2025  
- Health focus: post-hip-replacement rehab & low-gravity performance ergonomics work with NASA physiologists  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Serious vintage motorcycle collector (owns 70+ bikes; restores engines himself—great “surprising fact” prompt)  
- Lifelong boating enthusiast; holds a 300-ton captain’s license, loves nautical history trivia  
- Philosophy: “Music is time travel—every song is a three-minute passport.” Believes art must cross generations and now, planets  
- Night-sky photography hobby since COVID lockdown; owns a custom 14-inch Dobsonian scope, eager to shoot Earth-rise from the Moon  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn by the chance to play the prototype carbon-fiber “Lunar Grand” piano Steinway built for 1/6 g conditions  
- Seeks collaborators to engineer pristine audio capture in a pressurized dome; goal: release first hi-fidelity live album recorded off-Earth  
- Curious about social dynamics in micro-communities—how isolation influences creativity and memory recall  
- Offers star power for media buzz, a mini-set of space-themed classics (“Vienna,” “Summer, Highland Falls”) during the dinner  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX live-streaming team; Dolby Labs immersive audio R&D lead; NASA behavioral science group  
- Value exchange: willing to lend his catalog for experimental VR soundscapes in Planta’s next-gen social platform  
- Engage him with questions about motorcycle restorations or deep-sky photography; invite him to test the dome’s acoustics pre-event  
- Provide a quiet rehearsal slot and a keyboard with weighted action comparable to his Yamaha C7 to secure impromptu performance  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers candid, small-group conversation—keeps a low profile to avoid paparazzi; no ask for selfies  
- Sensitive topic: past hearing loss concerns—ensure in-dome monitors are at safe SPL levels  
- Follow-up query: confirm whether his catalog sale closes before 2026; affects licensing flexibility for event content distribution
