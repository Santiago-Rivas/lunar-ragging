### CURRENT PRIORITIES

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Unwinds by playing Chopin nocturnes on a restored 1890 Steinway—relaxes before major arguments  
- Runs sunrise 10Ks; claims pacing breath helps craft oral-argument cadence  
- Guiding maxim: “Hopelessness is the enemy of justice.”  
- Fascinated by architectural symbolism—studies cathedrals and lunar habitat design sketches alike  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to provoke discussion on justice, memory, and forgiveness in off-world communities  
- Aims to swap ideas on embedding restorative-justice protocols into early lunar governance charters  
- Looking for partners to beta-test EJI’s VR “History of Human Dignity” installation in microgravity settings

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Prime introductions:  
  • CTOs of immersive-tech firms (e.g., Magic Leap, Unity) for VR collaboration  
  • Philanthropic leads at Rockefeller Foundation & Omidyar Network—both circling his fellowship endowment  
  • Astrobotic/SpaceX habitat designers interested in equitable community guidelines  
- Host angle: ask about his grandmother’s garden lessons—he loves connecting moral growth to soil & space metaphors  
- Seat him near chefs: he’s intrigued by food as cultural memory vehicle and will riff on “taste as testimony”  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers depth over breadth—fewer, richer conversations beat rapid meet-and-greet blasts  
- Steers clear of partisan point-scoring; frame topics around shared humanity  
- Follow-up queries: status of VR lab fundraising round; his vision for an “Interplanetary Lynching Memorial” concept sketch circulating privately  
- Sensitive: declining two prior moon-event invitations due to perceived gimmickry—assure him this dinner centers substantive dialogue, not spectacle
