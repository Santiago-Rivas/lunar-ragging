### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Max Levchin

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: San Francisco, CA  
- Secondary time split between New York (Affirm investor meetings) & Kyiv (humanitarian/tech corridors)  
- Routinely logs trans-Pacific trips on Singapore Airlines “red-eye think-weeks” to draft product specs in uninterrupted stretches  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Affirm (NASDAQ: AFRM) – $32 B BNPL platform expanding into credit infrastructure for emerging markets  
- Co-founder, PayPal; founding father of “PayPal Mafia” influence network  
- Active GP, Sci-Fin Ventures – early bets on fertility tech, computational biology, and commercial space logistics  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Steering Affirm’s 2025 roll-out of instant cross-border lending rails (latency under 200 ms)  
- Incubating LunaLedger, a smart-contract framework for off-Earth commerce (quiet R&D cell of 9 engineers)  
- Mobilizing $50 M matching fund for Ukrainian deep-tech startups focused on cryptography & drone autonomy  
- Personal: training for his first Ironman 70.3; using HRV data to inform software “focus sprints”  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong cryptography geek—still solves CTF challenges under the alias “n_squared” for mental warm-ups  
- Collects vintage Soviet cosmonaut mission patches; cites “Korolev’s stubborn optimism” as a guiding mantra  
- Believes debt can be “a dignity accelerator” when priced transparently  
- Unusual fact: maintains a basement lab where he hand-builds modular analog synthesizers; swears the knob-twiddling resets his strategic thinking  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: championing financial primitives for lunar & Martian settlements—wants feedback on LunaLedger trust models  
- Seeks dialogue on biometrics in low-gravity commerce authentication and how social credit norms shift off-planet  
- Offers: war-stories on scaling trust networks, access to PayPal-Mafia alumni for joint moonshot funding, and insights on consumer psychology in novel environments  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: SpaceX Starlink payment ops lead, NASA human-factors chief, and any chef experimenting with AI-generated flavor pairings (possible Affirm marketing collab)  
- Attendees can assist by stress-testing his lunar risk-pricing algorithm with diverse cultural assumptions  
- Engage him by asking “What non-obvious failure mode keeps you up at night for off-world economies?”—he’ll open up fast  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers walk-and-talks over seated chats; cadence of movement sharpens his thinking  
- Dislikes small talk about traditional banking; pivot quickly to future economic architectures  
- Follow-up Q for host: dig deeper into his synthesizer hobby—identify if he’d compose a custom soundscape for Planta’s next immersive event
