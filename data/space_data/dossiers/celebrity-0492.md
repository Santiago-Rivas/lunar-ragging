### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Marc Andreessen

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Atherton, CA; daily presence at a16z headquarters in Menlo Park
- Routinely splits weeks between Silicon Valley, Washington D.C. (policy outreach), and Miami (crypto hub)
- Quarterly “frontier sweeps” to Austin, Los Alamos, and Hawthorne to review aerospace & defense portfolio companies

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & General Partner, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) – $35 B AUM across tech, bio, crypto, and “American Dynamism”
- Historic co-creator of Mosaic browser & co-founder of Netscape; coined the maxim “software is eating the world”
- Board seats: Meta Platforms, Flow, multiple a16z funds; informal advisor to SpaceX policy team

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Raising $1.2 B “Frontier Growth II” vehicle with dedicated allocation for orbital manufacturing, lunar logistics, and generative-AI infrastructure
- Publishing a follow-up manifesto to “It’s Time to Build,” focused on off-planet civilization economics (draft targeted for Q4 2025)
- Incubating three stealth startups: autonomous regolith printers, neuro-adaptive VR headsets, and a crypto-secured property-rights layer for space
- Personal goal: complete a private pilot’s license + suborbital certification before 2027 to validate investor-founder empathy in aerospace

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong science-fiction addict; cites Iain M. Banks’ Culture series as blueprint for post-scarcity society
- Night-owl polymath: knocks out 1,000-page books in a weekend; tweets stream-of-consciousness threads at 2 a.m.
- Gourmet curiosity: collects rare salts and ancient grains; excited to sample “lunar terroir” flavors from regolith-grown crops
- Guiding belief: “Invention creates moral obligation—if we can build abundance, we must.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence underscores Planta’s thesis that social experience is the next great tech platform—even in micro-gravity
- Seeking founders, scientists, and chefs who can prove the Moon as a viable supply-chain node for human culture (food, art, entertainment)
- Will happily trade early-stage checks or policy introductions for convincing demos of closed-loop life-support or spatial-computing social layers
- Offers provocative narrative framing that can magnetize capital and talent to lunar ventures

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Dr. Ellen Kim (ISS research director) on bio-regenerative systems  
  • Chef Dominique Crenn on micro-gravity gastronomy  
  • ESA procurement lead Marta Rossi on lunar ISRU partnerships
- Attendees can assist by sharing hard data on regolith extraction costs, hab tech readiness levels, or novel social-VR engagement metrics
- Engaging him: skip small talk; ask, “What civilization-scale problem becomes solvable once we have continuous lunar presence?”—then offer a bold viewpoint

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Values candor and intellectual intensity; disengages if conversation drifts to nostalgia or trivial valuations
- Sensitive to regulatory pessimism—frame obstacles as solvable engineering challenges
- Follow-up question: details on the upcoming a16z “Frontiers Fellowship” and how Planta Network innovators might slot in after the event
