### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Alina Morse

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Ann Arbor, MI (family HQ & ZolliCandy operations)
- Secondary hub: Los Angeles, CA for media shoots and West-Coast retail partners
- Regular international swings to London & Tokyo—tracking sugar-free confectionery trends and Gen-Z consumer insights

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, ZolliCandy (Zollipops, ZolliDrops, ZolliPB Cups) – #1 sugar-free candy brand in U.S. natural grocery channel
- Youngest entrepreneur to appear on the cover of Entrepreneur Magazine; debuted at age 9 on the floor of NASDAQ
- UN “Generation Unlimited” youth ambassador; driving global oral-health advocacy

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a $25 M growth round to expand into functional snacking (prebiotic gummies, oral-care chocolates) with dentist-backed R&D
- Piloting AI-based flavor-prediction models to reduce new-product failure rates by 40 %
- Planning a 2026 “Million Smiles Tour” across 15 emerging markets—bundling dental-care curriculum with street-food pop-ups
- Personally exploring dual-degree options in Public Health and Business at University of Michigan (deferred admission until 2026)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Competitive hip-hop dancer; credits choreography sessions for most product-naming inspiration
- Keeps a private collection of vintage astronaut food packets—fascinated by space nutrition history
- Guiding philosophy: “If you can sweeten a smile, you can sweeten a future.”
- Reads one patent per week outside her category to spark cross-industry mashups (recently diving into fungal mycelium packaging)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Brought aboard as the “sweet taste of zero-gravity”: prototyping a xylitol-based, crumb-free lunar dessert sphere that dissolves cleanly in low-G
- Seeks dialogue on closed-loop food systems, nano-encapsulation of nutrients, and how to maintain oral health when fluoride access is limited off-Earth
- Offers a youth-driven consumer lens on how to make space experiences aspirational—and marketable—on Earth

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intro requests: NASA Food Technology Commercialization Team; Axiom Space consumer-experience lead; Patagonia Provisions sustainability chemists
- Open to co-branding with luxury chefs attending the dinner to craft “interplanetary dessert flights”
- Energizes in small brainstorm huddles—pitch her a crazy idea, then give her five quiet minutes with a notebook

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers almond-milk lattes; allergic to cashews—flag for catering
- Avoid framing her as a “kidpreneur” – she’s keen to shift narrative to “next-gen CPG innovator”
- Follow-up Q for deeper engagement: How far along is her dental-health NFT initiative that funds school clinics via smart-contract royalties?
