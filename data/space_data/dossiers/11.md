### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Certified rescue scuba diver; logs annual deep-reef expeditions to map coral health with Woods Hole scientists
- Collects lunar and Martian meteorite slices—keeps a 23-gram NWA 13914 fragment on her desk as a focus talisman
- Favorite maxim: “Systems win; people keep them honest.” Views governance design as the ultimate competitive moat
