### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Mike Cannon-Brookes

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Sydney, Australia (family estate in Centennial Park)
- Secondary hub: Brooklyn Heights loft for Atlassian’s NYC outpost
- Regular circuits: Singapore (SunCable HQ build-out), San Francisco (Atlassian R&D), Davos & COP summits
- Known for booking “climate-neutral sprint weeks” on short notice; often travels with a compact satellite uplink kit for uninterrupted connectivity

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-Founder & Co-CEO, Atlassian (NASDAQ: TEAM) – $60 B collaboration software titan
- Executive Chair, SunCable 2.0 – 10 GW solar-plus-hydrogen project linking Northern Territory to Southeast Asia
- Limited partner in Grok Ventures Climate Fund ($3 B AUM) focused on hard-tech decarbonization
- Key influence: architect of Atlassian’s “Team Anywhere” program; vocal driver of Australia’s 82 % renewables target by 2030

### CURRENT PRIORITIES (NEXT 6–12 MONTHS)
- Integrating generative-AI code assistant “AtlasBot” across Atlassian Cloud, aiming for GA release at Team ’26
- Securing final environmental approvals for SunCable’s subsea HVDC line; negotiating offtake with Temasek-backed data centers
- Exploring Lunar Microgrid Initiative: pilot 50 kW flexible-solar + sodium-sulfur battery array adaptable to low-gravity dust conditions
- Personal: training for a solo trans-Pacific leg on his retro-fitted, hydrogen-assisted sailing yacht “Zephyr”

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects vintage Moog synthesizers; composes ambient tracks during red-eye flights
- Maintains a private Slack channel, “SpaceXcel,” where he and friends simulate off-world economies
- Guiding maxim: “Work should orbit talent, not geography.”
- Little-known twist: spent a semester at UNSW studying marine biology before pivoting to computer science—still scuba dives to log coral health data

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited as a marquee tech-meets-sustainability voice; Atlassian’s collaboration suite underpins Planta’s lunar ops dashboard
- Intends to glean first-hand data on human factors inside a sealed lunar habitat for future software design cues
- Actively scouting partners for regolith-embedded solar film R&D and closed-loop water recycling IP
- Offers: playbook for scaling distributed teams in extreme environments; potential joint press moment linking lunar sustainability to Earth climate action

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: ESA & JAXA procurement heads (lunar power), Michelin-star chefs exploring zero-waste gastronomy, sovereign wealth funds eyeing space-based solar
- Asks: engineers experienced in vacuum-rated power connectors; social scientists studying micro-community resilience
- Engage him with visionary “what-if” scenarios; segue into music or yacht racing for quick rapport

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers direct, data-rich dialogue—detests “thought-leadership” fluff
- Time-boxed: will depart T-2 hrs post-dessert to catch an Earth-return window synced with kids’ school start
- Avoid probing Atlassian’s rumored AI-native IDE spin-off (board NDA active)
- Follow-up question for the host’s prompt: Ask about his coral-reef fieldwork; few know he logs footage using a custom Atlassian app named “ReefJira.”
