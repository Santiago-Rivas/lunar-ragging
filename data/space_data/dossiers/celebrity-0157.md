### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Anne Hathaway

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Upper West Side, Manhattan; secondary base in Los Angeles for production meetings
- Regular rotation through London and Vancouver sets; maintains “every-other-month” trips to Geneva for UN Women initiatives

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Actor–Producer, two-time Academy Award recipient (Acting & Producing categories)
- Founder, Quiet Girl Productions—focus on high-concept, impact-driven storytelling across film, TV, and immersive media
- UN Women Global Goodwill Ambassador; vocal advocate for equitable parental leave and childcare policy in creative industries

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Pre-production on “LUMINA,” a limited series blending live action and volumetric capture for Apple Vision Pro launch (Q4 2026)
- Co-developing a sustainable couture capsule with Stella McCartney; proceeds earmarked for childcare access grants
- Training for directorial debut (short VR narrative on intergenerational empathy); quietly shadowing Denis Villeneuve on “Dune: Messiah” set summer 2025
- Personal goal: earn Advanced Open Water scuba certification before 2026 to support ongoing coral-reef documentary narration project

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Habitual 5 AM runner; swears early-morning solitude “recalibrates creative bandwidth”
- Collects antique fountain pens; journals daily in cursive—quotes Nabokov: “Caress the detail, the divine detail.”
- Space-curious since childhood; keeps signed photo of Apollo 11 crew on office wall and follows SpaceX Starship test livestreams
- Counter-intuitive fun fact she rarely reveals: studied clowning under Jacques Lecoq methodology—still practices silent improv drills backstage

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- High recognition factor as “Dr. Brand” from Interstellar makes her a natural narrative bridge between popular culture and real lunar presence
- Seeking collaborators to prototype zero-gravity performance art that could stream to Earth classrooms—wants STEM engagement angle
- Offers star-power amplification: willing to host 3-minute on-site interview for Planta’s social channels to broaden mission visibility

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intro desired to: 
  • XR hardware leads at Magic Leap or Varjo for LUMINA capture pipeline  
  • Axiom Space outreach team on educational payload concepts  
- Valuable to attendees: candid insights on negotiating creative control in studio-streamer hybrids; advocacy tips for family-friendly production sets
- Ideal engagement tactic: pose big-picture, values-anchored questions (“What story do you wish the first children born on the Moon will tell?”) rather than filmography trivia

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers one-on-one or micro-group chats over stagey networking; discreet meeting spot suggested during station’s “Earthrise” viewing window
- Avoid joking about tabloids or “princess” roles; she consciously steers toward future-leaning topics
- Follow-up prompt: ask how clowning training shapes her leadership style—aligns perfectly with host’s “unusual or surprising” conversation goal
