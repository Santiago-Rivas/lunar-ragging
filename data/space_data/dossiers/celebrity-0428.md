### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Carlo Rovelli

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Marseille, France (Centre de Physique Théorique, Luminy campus)
- Maintains pied-à-terre in Verona; seasonal residencies in Vancouver & Oaxaca for writing retreats
- Travel rhythm: alternates six-week research blocks with ten-day “roving salons” at festivals, book fairs, and philosophy symposiums worldwide

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Theoretical physicist & co-founder, Loop Quantum Gravity field; Visiting Professor, Western Ontario & Perimeter Institute
- International best-selling author (Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, Helgoland); books translated into 50+ languages
- Honors include Lewis Thomas Prize for Science Writing, Legion of Honour (France), and frequent TED main-stage curator

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Leading a cross-institution project to simulate quantum spacetime on next-gen photonic processors—aim: publish first dynamic visualizations by mid-2026
- Drafting new book “Breath of Time” exploring consciousness, memory, and the cosmological arrow—deadline spring 2027
- Advocating for an open-access “Library of Cosmic Questions,” a multilingual platform pairing physicists with poets to crowd-source explanations of unsolved problems
- Personal: finalizing skipper certification; planning a solo Mediterranean sailing loop as a meditative break post-manuscript

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobbies: jazz drumming (joined impromptu sets at two Nobel banquets), free-diving, 17th-century Venetian poetry
- Guiding view: “Reality is a web of relations; objects and people exist only through their interactions”
- Unknown tidbit: spent a semester in his twenties apprenticing with circus acrobats, studying balance to intuitively grasp center-of-mass principles

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar setting aligns with his fascination for observational vantage points—already sketched a thought experiment on quantum reference frames for low-gravity dinners
- Seeking dialogue on blending immersive XR with rigorous science outreach; intrigued by Planta’s experiential technology stack
- Can offer brief, mind-bending “moonside chats” on relativity vs. lunar tidal locking, enhancing the event’s intellectual allure

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: 
  • Experiential design firm Moment Factory (loves their cathedral projections)  
  • Artemis program leads for potential educational tie-ins  
  • Philanthropic patrons funding cross-disciplinary arts–science residencies
- Attendees can assist by sharing sensor data from lunar habitat to feed his quantum-gravity visualization demos
- Engagement tip: present a paradox or poetic quote—he’ll riff on it; keep conversation fluid rather than slide-deck formal

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers intimate circles over large panels; schedule a quiet pre-dinner espresso ritual if possible
- Sensitive to over-commercialization of science—frame partnerships around curiosity & public benefit
- Follow-up Qs: feasibility of moon-based radio-quiet zone for quantum-cosmology experiments; interest level in co-authoring immersive essay series for Planta’s platform
