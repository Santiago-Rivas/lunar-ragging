### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong art-history buff; collects mid-century Brazilian furniture
- Practices sketch comedy improv to sharpen on-court focus; guest-performed at The Groundlings in March 2025
- Favorite credo: “Discipline is freedom”—credits daily 5 a.m. writing ritual for mental health
- Exploring how micro-gravity can accelerate tendon-repair research after sports injuries

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the lunar dinner as proof-of-concept for inclusive, wellness-oriented gatherings in space tourism
- Eager to discuss: adaptive athletic wear for variable-gravity environments, mental-performance protocols for off-Earth crews, and equitable access models for commercial spaceflight
