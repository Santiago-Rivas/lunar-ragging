### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Steve Wozniak

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Los Gatos, California; keeps a low-key cabin in Tahoe for “tech-free” weekends
- Global speaker circuit: averages two international keynotes per month; pattern shows yearly pilgrimages to Tokyo (robotics expos) and Zürich (ETH collaborations)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder, Apple Inc.; presently Founder & Chief Visionary, Woz Labs (stealth nonprofit advancing open-hardware education)
- Co-founder, Privateer Space (commercial space-data infrastructure) and Woz U (coding & cybersecurity bootcamps)
- IEEE Masaru Ibuka Award, National Medal of Technology, and recently inducted into the Space Technology Hall of Fame for Privateer’s Astrosite debris-tracking platform

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Spearheading “K-12 to Orbit” initiative: deploy student-built CubeSats by 2028; fundraising $60 M
- Building a blockchain-authenticated archive of vintage Apple schematics for public domain release
- Personal goal: complete NASA parabolic flight certification to film an educational micro-gravity series with Khan Academy
- Quietly scouting lunar-surface data-relay partners for Privateer’s next-gen optical mesh

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Founder & goalie of the Silicon Valley Aftershocks Segway Polo club; still practices weekly
- Lifelong prankster—keeps a pocket-sized jam-jar of LEDs to “hack” table décor lighting at dinners
- Philosophy: “Technology is best when it disappears into fun”; champions radical openness, dislikes walled gardens
- Unusual fact he enjoys sharing: once wired his entire house to play random Beatles riffs when the front door opens

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar dinner aligns with Privateer’s ambition to map near-surface orbital debris from a stable vantage; eager to discuss in-situ sensor packages
- Seeking collaborators on immersive, zero-latency social platforms for space habitats—wants to blend Woz Labs’ open-hardware ethos with Planta’s experiential UI
- Offers legendary storytelling draw and technical gravitas to media coverage; can demo a prototype “lunar LAN” node the size of a coaster

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Intuitive Machines (lunar lander comms)  
  • UNESCO Space4Education taskforce  
  • Michelin-starred chef Dominique Crenn (for edible electronics concept)
- Attendees can help by pledging student-payload slots, offering XR content partnerships, or co-sponsoring the open-schematics archive
- Engage him with playful, engineering-centric challenges (e.g., hack-the-table centerpieces); follow with concrete asks—he commits on the spot when energized

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers informal address (“Woz”), bright lighting, and strong black coffee; hearing is slightly diminished—speak clearly in crowds
- Avoid protracted “Apple vs. Jobs” nostalgia; he values forward-looking dialogue
- Follow-up intel worth gathering: status of Privateer’s Series B close date and any regulatory hurdles for lunar optical mesh spectrum
