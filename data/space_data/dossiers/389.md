### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Bill Gates

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Medina, WA with regular weeks in London (Breakthrough Energy Europe) and Washington, D.C. (policy meetings)
- Predictable quarterly swing through Boston–Cambridge biotech corridor; ad-hoc travel to emerging-market field sites (Nigeria, Bangladesh) for foundation programs

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (US $75 B endowment)
- Founder, Breakthrough Energy & TerraPower; board observer at OpenAI
- Key achievements: eradication-trajectory work on polio; catalytic investments that cut clean-hydrogen costs 35 % since 2021; orchestrated $4 B pandemic-response coalition across 11 sovereign funds

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling next-gen small modular nuclear (Natrium) plant breaking ground in Wyoming, slated 2030 grid connection
- Assembling a $20 B “Climate Adaptation Finance Vehicle” to de-risk heat-resilient crops for Africa & South Asia
- Personal R&D curiosity: closed-loop bio-reactors that convert human waste into fertilizer and hydrogen—seen as dual-use for extreme-environment habitats
- Writing a concise “AI for Global Health” field manual—draft due to publisher Q1 2026
- Leisure goal: bring tournament-level bridge back into mainstream via streaming partnerships; explores VR-enabled gameplay

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Voracious reader—has a private list of sci-fi centering on off-world ethics; lately praising Project Hail Mary as the best STEM primer for non-engineers
- Collects rare nautical charts from the Age of Discovery; sees them as analogues to today’s lunar mapping efforts
- Guiding philosophy: “Technological optimism must be matched by measurement.” Keeps pocket notebook of metrics he wants before funding any idea.
- Surprising fact: taught himself to shell oysters and maintain a salt-water tank during lockdown—claims it sharpened his patience more than bridge

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: strategic thinker on sustaining life in resource-scarce environments; can speak to energy, sanitation, and health systems for extraterrestrial habitats
- Seeking: firsthand user feedback on human psychology in confined off-Earth settings to inform mental-health modules in Gates Foundation’s “Health in Space, Health on Earth” initiative
- Potential contribution: blueprint for modular nuclear-thermal generators sized for lunar outposts; offers access to Breakthrough Energy Fellows for follow-on tech validation

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Lunar horticulture teams needing grant-matching  
  • Institutional investors open to concessionary returns for adaptation tech  
  • Behavioral scientists tracking group dynamics in isolated communities
- How attendees can help: share real-world data on material recycling rates in micro-gravity; discuss cross-licensing of water electrolysis IP
- Engagement tips: open with a data point he hasn’t seen; segue into a book recommendation; invite him to a friendly, rapid bridge deal using a pocket deck he often carries

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers precision—avoid broad “save the world” language; frame requests with measurable milestones
- Steers clear of personal-life topics post-divorce; focus on mission, not gossip
- Follow-up Qs worth asking: status of AI-driven vaccine-design pipeline; interest level in funding lunar-based antimicrobial testing suites
