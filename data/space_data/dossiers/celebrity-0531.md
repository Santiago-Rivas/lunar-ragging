### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Tarana Burke

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Harlem, New York City
- Regular circuits through Atlanta, Los Angeles, and Abuja for survivor-advocacy partnerships and diaspora-focused initiatives
- Known for “impact sprints” — 72-hour pop-ups in cities to catalyze local grassroots leaders

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Executive Director, MeToo International (global policy + digital community arm of #MeToo)
- Senior Advisor, Ford Foundation Gender, Race & Ethnicity program
- Recent accolades: 2024 Nobel Peace Prize shortlist; Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award for Social Progress

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Building “SafeVerse,” a Web3-enabled survivor support platform aiming for 1 M verified members by 2026
- Negotiating a bipartisan U.S. Senate task-force on tech-facilitated gender-based violence (hearings slated Q3 2025)
- Personal: drafting a speculative-fiction memoir intertwining Afrofuturism with her Alabama childhood; target publisher auction fall 2025
- Exploring micro-grant program for Indigenous and Global South organizations combating sexual violence in conflict zones

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Deep Afrofuturism enthusiast; cites Octavia Butler’s “Earthseed” as her north star for community resilience
- Weekend passion: hunts rare ’70s soul vinyl; spins DJ sets under the alias “TB Groove” at secret pop-ups
- Philosophy: “Survival is nonlinear; healing should be, too”—embraces multidimensional storytelling to foster empathy
- Unexpected skill: certified scuba diver; treats deep-sea silence as meditative counterbalance to public life

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Moon dinner’s symbolism of reclaiming space—literally—for marginalized voices
- Wants candid dialogue on safeguarding psychological safety in frontier environments (lunar bases, metaverse, deep-sea habitats)
- Investigating partnerships where XR/AR overlays can facilitate consent-education modules; scouting developers and ethics researchers
- Brings narrative power: can anchor the evening’s reflections on human dignity in extreme settings

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Prime intros: 
  • Gwynne Shotwell (SpaceX) re: allocating launch-mass for humanitarian payloads  
  • Sheila Jagannathan (World Bank ed-tech) to scale consent curriculum globally  
  • Tim Sweeney (Epic Games) on embedding survivor-support APIs in game engines
- Host leverage: frame her at a roundtable with fellow social-impact technologists before the formal dinner; she thrives in small-group strategy jams
- Engagement tip: open with science-fiction queries (“Which Butler verse belongs on the Moon?”) rather than activism headlines—signals genuine curiosity

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Zero tolerance for performative allyship; appreciates actionable commitments over public statements
- Avoid pressuring her for survivor stories; focus on systemic change levers
- Follow-up: gauge her appetite for co-authoring a post-event white paper on “Ethics of Extraterrestrial Community Building”
