### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Tessa Thompson

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Angeles (Silver Lake); maintains pied-à-terre in Brooklyn for East-Coast shoots
- Regular filming circuits: London’s Pinewood, Atlanta’s Trilith, and Wellington (frequent Marvel/VFX work)
- Recently added monthly Houston stopovers to train at Johnson Space Center’s Neutral Buoyancy Lab for an upcoming space-set film

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Actor-producer; founder, Viva Maude Productions (first-look deal with HBO & Orion)
- Breakout franchises: Valkyrie in Marvel’s Thor & Avengers films; Bianca in Creed trilogy; Charlotte Hale in Westworld
- Key influence areas  
  • Industry voice on intersectional representation  
  • Early adopter of volumetric/LED-stage filming techniques

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Pre-production on directorial debut: semi-autobiographical Afro-Latinx surrealist feature, targeting Sundance 2028
- Executive-producing a mixed-reality series that blends episodic drama with live XR events; shopping hardware partnerships
- Training in zero-g environments to authenticate performance for “The Liminal Orbit,” a prestige miniseries set entirely on a lunar colony
- Personal horizon: intends to purchase a small parcel in Chile’s Atacama Desert to build an artists-in-residence observatory by 2029

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate vinyl collector; curates playlists keyed to characters she plays—great icebreaker if music is playing during the dinner
- Self-described “ingredient nerd”: experiments with obscure botanicals; traveling with a custom tincture kit to infuse cocktails
- Favorite maxim: “Stories expand gravitational fields—people can’t help but fall in”
- Keeps a pocket sketchbook of speculative architecture; secretly drafts habitat modules for off-world living

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence underscores Hollywood’s intensifying interest in authentic space narratives and cross-medium storytelling
- Looking to:  
  • Meet lunar habitat engineers to verify set designs for The Liminal Orbit  
  • Explore sponsorship or co-creation with avant-garde chefs for an edible-storytelling segment in her XR series  
  • Gauge public appetite for live performances transmitted from low-gravity stages
- Can contribute compelling commentary on valuing art and culture in extraterrestrial environments; potent on-camera sound bites for event docu-teams

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros sought: NASA’s Artemis culture program leads; Bleu Capital (immersive media fund); chef-scientist collective Studio Food++  
- Attendees can help by sharing lessons from human-factor research in confinement and isolation—she’s building character psych profiles
- Engagement tips: open with music or food talk, segue into how sensory experiences change in micro-gravity; avoid standard Marvel chit-chat

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: fiercely private about family and dating life—steer clear
- “Unusual or surprising” prompt cue: she once spent a summer in Oaxaca apprenticing under a master weaver; still travels with her backstrap loom
- Follow-up intel to gather: timelines for Planta’s next off-world social experiments—possible shoot locations for a Viva Maude short
