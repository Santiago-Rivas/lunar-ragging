### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Alison Bechdel

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Bolton, Vermont hillside studio; winters often spent in Boulder, CO for altitude training & proximity to family
- Consistent pattern: two-month artist residencies abroad every other year (recently Kyoto and Reykjavík) to reset creative rhythm

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Graphic memoirist & cartoonist; MacArthur “Genius” Fellow
- Creator of “Dykes to Watch Out For,” groundbreaking LGBTQ+ comic strip; author of best-selling memoirs “Fun Home,” “Are You My Mother?” and “The Secret to Superhuman Strength”
- Cultural touchpoint: the “Bechdel Test,” now referenced in >6 M academic & media citations

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Developing a hybrid animated/VR adaptation of “Fun Home” with A24 Labs; seeking immersive tech partners to prototype spatial storytelling
- Drafting a short, visually driven manifesto on queer ecologies & climate grief, slated for serialization in The New Yorker late 2026
- Personal aim: complete all 46 Adirondack High Peaks by summer 2026, sketching each summit for upcoming art book “Elevation Lines”

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Daily morning ‘micro-comics’ practice (one ink panel before coffee); claims this 7-minute ritual is her true “superhuman strength”
- Fascinated by physiques in zero-G—keeps informal correspondence with astronaut-strength coach Mark Guilliams
- Guiding philosophy: “Structural honesty invites emotional truth”—applies to architecture, bodies, and relationships alike
- Plays the accordion—believes the bellows mirror the lung motion of comic panels “breathing” across a page

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the lunar setting as the literal “blank panel” for reimagining human narratives beyond Earth
- Looking to swap insights on: embodiment in reduced gravity, symbolism of lunar cycles in storytelling, and novel publishing formats for off-planet audiences
- Offers live sketchnote reportage of the dinner, producing limited-edition accordion-fold mini-comics for guests within 24 hours

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: XR hardware designers at Planta, NASA’s Art-Science Program, and sustainability ethicists exploring off-world habitats
- Potential collaborator for Planta’s social-connectivity R&D: creating graphic diaries that capture affective data through visual metaphors
- Best engagement tactic: invite her to quietly observe prep stages—she sketches while absorbing ambience, then opens up during reflective debriefs

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Surprising fact to prompt: her private archive of 1960s lesbian pulp cover art—she curates pop-up “lunar pulp” collages for friends
- Sensitive: avoids topical jokes about the Bechdel Test; prefers deeper dialogue on how metrics shape art
- Future query: status of her planned “Gravity & Grace” essay collection comparing rock climbing knots to narrative structures
