### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Paul Simon

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Upper West Side, Manhattan; secondary home and private studio in Wimberley, TX hill country
- Regular circuits: London (grandchildren), Johannesburg (ongoing cultural exchange projects), Los Angeles (film-score collaborations)
- Accepts only 6–8 travel commitments per year; prioritizes destinations offering strong acoustic or ecological inspiration

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Legendary singer-songwriter; catalog exceeds 600 recorded works, 16 Grammy Awards, two Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductions
- Founder, Quiet Light Productions – boutique studio focusing on immersive spatial-audio releases and archival remastering
- Co-chair, Children’s Rhythms Initiative – funds early-childhood music education in underserved communities worldwide

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Composing “Cosmos Cantata,” an experimental piece meant to leverage low-gravity resonances; seeking scientific input on lunar acoustics
- Partnering with Dolby Laboratories on adaptive binaural mixes of his back catalogue for AR headsets
- Personal quest: preserving endangered folk melodies through field recordings in Amazonia and the Sahel (2025–2026 expeditions planned)
- Health: adapting live-performance formats to mitigate left-ear hearing loss; favors intimate, acoustically rich settings

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong fascination with astronomy; owns a vintage Questar telescope and logs lunar observations nightly from Texas ranch
- Secret pastime: builds elaborate model-train dioramas depicting 1950s New York subway lines—keeps a 200-sq-ft layout under his studio
- Guiding philosophy: “Constraint sparks melody”—believes physical limits (space, gravity, silence) unlock creative breakthroughs
- Enjoys impromptu word-games; collects rare cross-lingual puns as songwriting prompts

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner for its promise of unprecedented acoustic conditions; wants to test sung tones against lunar habitat reverberation
- Hoping to meet material scientists who can craft ultralight resonant instruments for off-planet performances
- Brings cultural gravitas and a decades-long track record of cross-disciplinary collaboration—ideal for sparking arts-science dialogues
- Open to offering a short, surprise a cappella piece tailored to the habitat’s acoustic profile

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA acoustics team, MIT Media Lab’s Opera of the Future group, and any VR platform builders capturing spatial performances
- Potential co-creation: limited-edition lunar soundscape NFT series benefiting Children’s Rhythms Initiative
- Engage him by asking about the “unexpected sounds” he anticipates on the Moon—ties directly to host’s question on surprising facts
- Offer a quiet corner with a calibrated microphone setup so he can capture ambient hum for “Cosmos Cantata”

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers low-light, low-noise environments—advance notice if loud tech demos are planned
- Subtly check interest in post-event Earth-based showcase linking lunar audio experiments to youth-music fundraisers
- Follow-up question: Would he donate an original lyric fragment written on the Moon for a charitable auction?
