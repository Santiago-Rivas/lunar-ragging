### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: N’Djamena, Chad; secondary base in Paris for UN & policy engagements  
- Rotates monthly between Sahel field sites, New York (UNHQ), and Bonn (UNFCCC); rarely stays more than three weeks in one city  
- Known for accepting last-minute travel if it advances indigenous climate initiatives—keep schedules flexible

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- President, Association for Indigenous Women & Peoples of Chad (AFPAT)  
- UN SDG Advocate; co-chair, International Indigenous Peoples’ Forum on Climate Change  
- EarthShot Prize Council member; TIME “100 Next” environmental leader  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling a Sahel-wide early-warning system that fuses satellite data with indigenous weather indicators—pilot funding secured through ESA; seeking tech partners for phase II automation  
- Building an Indigenous-led carbon market that channels ≥70 % of revenues directly to pastoralist communities by 2026  
- Drafting a “Rights of Nature in Outer Space” framework—positioning indigenous stewardship principles for off-Earth habitats ahead of Artemis-era policy debates  
- Personal ambition: charter a zero-carbon expedition across the Sahara to document traditional grazing routes via VR for educational use

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Carries a collapsible drone in her daypack; self-taught pilot who maps grazing corridors at 5 m resolution  
- Collects vintage mission patches from every major space program—says they “remind us that exploration is always political”  
- Guiding ethos: “Land—or any habitat—is a relative, not a resource.”  
- Off-grid hobbies: Tuareg blues guitar; desert astronomy (knows how to navigate by Pleiades)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Brings crucial perspective on sustainable life-support: how closed-loop lunar systems can learn from nomadic resource frugality  
- Eager to discuss low-impact construction materials, indigenous governance models for shared commons, and ethical data ownership in space  
- Seeks introductions to lunar-ag tech teams exploring regenerative soil substrates; offers field-tested knowledge on micro-climate management  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: ESA’s Deep Space Habitat program lead; Patagonia’s venture studio (for carbon market co-development); Y Combinator’s “Planetary” batch partners  
- Attendees can assist by offering remote-sensing datasets, micro-grant pathways for women pastoralists, or seats on advisory boards shaping extraterrestrial environmental policy  
- Optimal engagement: Start with her drone footage of Lake Chad shrinkage; segue into how water-stress lessons transfer to lunar ice mining—then ask for her view on “community ownership” of space resources

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Resists tokenization—ensure discussions go beyond “indigenous perspective” to concrete collaboration  
- Prefers tactile demos over slide decks; a lunar soil analogue sample on-site will captivate her  
- Follow-up Qs for deeper rapport: status of carbon market regulatory filings in the Central African franc zone; her draft principles for off-Earth environmental justice
