### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Placido Domingo

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Madrid; maintains apartments in New York City and Mexico City
- Touring schedule keeps him airborne three weeks each month; still insists on commercial flights to stay “connected to ordinary life”
- Spends 6–8 weeks annually at the family ranch near Acapulco for vocal rest and horses

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Preparing “Domingo@85” world tour (2026) featuring immersive XR scenery projected in theaters
- Commissioning a trilingual chamber opera based on Gabriel García Márquez’s “The Handsomest Drowned Man”
- Quietly scouting next-gen vocal health tech—wearable sensors that map diaphragm micro-tremors
- Personal: finalizing memoir “Breathing Space,” blending career anecdotes with reflections on spaceflight and sound

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong astronomy buff; owns a 20-inch Planewave telescope and logs lunar surface sketches between performances
- Keeps a private playlist of contemporary Latin trap to study evolving vocal phrasing
- Favorite maxim: “The ear never retires; it only sails to new oceans.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Fascinated by the acoustics of low-gravity environments; hopes to test sustained legato without full lung compression at the lunar base
- Looking to meet technologists who can sonically map the Moon’s regolith to inspire new orchestration textures
- Offers star power for Planta’s media coverage—willing to perform a short aria adapted for 0.16 g if logistics allow
- Seeks candid conversation starters: “What sound do you think the Moon wants to hear first?”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to SpaceX Starlink’s latency research team (potential live-cast of 2026 tour)

- Engage him by asking about the subtle rhythmic differences between Andalusian flamenco and lunar heartbeat simulations he’s drafting

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid dwelling on past harassment allegations; focus on forward-looking artistic ventures
