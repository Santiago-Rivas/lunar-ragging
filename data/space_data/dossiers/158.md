### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Glenn Close

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Manhattan, Upper West Side brownstone
- Secondary base: 1,000-acre family ranch in Bozeman, Montana
- Travel rhythm: Bi-monthly shuttles to Los Angeles for production meetings; summer weeks in London’s West End scouting stage revivals

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Actor-producer with 8 Academy Award nominations and an Honorary Oscar (2024) for lifetime achievement
- Executive Producer & lead, “Sunset Boulevard” feature (principal photography begins Q3 2026)
- Co-founder & Chair, Bring Change to Mind – national mental-health nonprofit reaching 7 M+ students

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing financing stack ($45 M gap) for “Sunset Boulevard” and retaining creative control
- Piloting an XR storytelling lab that pairs A-list performers with clinical psychologists to destigmatize mental illness through immersive narratives
- Personal goal: direct her first feature—an adaptation of Elizabeth Strout’s “Olive Kitteridge”—by late 2027
- Montana ranch conversion into a regenerative agriculture showcase; intends to certify it as carbon-negative within 12 months

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur astrophotographer; tracks lunar libration with a 14-inch Dobsonian telescope on clear Montana nights
- Collects 19th-century botanical etchings; claims the discipline of drawing plants sharpens her acting instincts
- Guiding belief: “Radical empathy is the only technology that never becomes obsolete.”
- Surprising quirk: travels with a portable sourdough starter (“Mr. DeMille”) and bakes whenever a set has an oven

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner’s theme of reimagining connection; wants to explore how micro-gravity performance can unlock new emotional registers
- Looking for partners with biometric or neurofeedback tech to integrate into XR mental-health experiences
- Can contribute marquee visibility, board-level nonprofit governance, and nuanced storytelling expertise around human vulnerability in extreme environments

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Behavioral Health & Performance team; Unity’s Director of Spatial Storytelling; Patagonia’s philanthropy arm for the ranch project
- Attendees can assist by sharing low-latency comms solutions for remote therapy or by pledging small-batch funding to her XR lab
- Engage her by asking which classic monologue she’d most like to deliver in lunar gravity or by comparing favorite telescope sites on Earth vs. the Moon

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers conversation circles of ≤5 people; overwhelmed by flash-photo crowds
- Minimal alcohol; offer herbal teas or sparkling water
- Avoid referencing “Fatal Attraction” unless she raises it—she’s bored of that topic
- Good follow-up: invite her to a private VR demo showing emotional state visualization; confirm via her manager, David Shaw, before June 2025
