### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: London (family & sustainability circle), Los Angeles (film production), and a quiet farmhouse in Oxfordshire used for “digital detox” writing retreats  
- Regular travel loop: Eurostar to Paris for fashion council work, quarterly NYC trips for UN Women & B-Corp board meetings, occasional Cape Town visits for rewilding project she co-founded

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Actor-producer; founder, Hestia Films—female-led storytelling and climate-positive production protocols  
- UN Women Goodwill Ambassador; architect of the “HeForShe” solidarity movement  
- Strategic investor in GOOD-ON-YOU (ethical fashion app) and Allbirds; board adviser to Kering’s Sustainability Innovation Lab  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Pre-production on “Gaia Rising,” a limited series set on a near-future eco-colony (executive producer & lead)  
- Partnering with ESA-backed startup MycoTex to pilot mushroom-based textiles for film costumes and eventual off-world habitats  
- Completing a part-time MSc in Environmental Technology at Imperial College—thesis on closed-loop material flows in remote settlements  
- Personal: cultivating a three-acre regenerative garden; aims to certify as a master beekeeper by 2026  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Relaxes with alpine climbing and manual carpentry—built her own writing desk; few know she carries a collapsible Japanese saw on shoots  
- Favorite quote: “We are not separate from nature; we are nature becoming conscious of itself.”  
- Keeps a private sci-fi book club (recent pick: “Project Hail Mary”); loves debating ethics of expansion beyond Earth  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a live case study for ethical design of extra-terrestrial communities  
- Eager to discuss: sustainable textiles suited to lunar gravity, gender-inclusive governance models for off-world bases, and narrative framing that normalizes climate stewardship in space exploration  
- Offers celebrity reach plus policy fluency—can amplify Planta’s vision across entertainment and UN channels  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: Blue Origin’s orbital habitat sustainability team; Patagonia’s Tin Shed Ventures; astronaut‐diet R&D group at NASA Ames  
- Attendees can assist by sharing insights on hydroponic culinary crops adaptable to low-gravity kitchens  
- Engage her with hands-on demos: tactile samples of basalt fiber fabric or VR walk-throughs of regenerative lunar greenhouses; keep discussions substantive, data-rich, and values-aligned  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers small circles over crowds; schedule a quiet corner or stargazing window seat during the meal  
- Sensitive point: avoids invasive questions about early fame; thrives on forward-looking, solution-centric dialogue  
- Surprising anecdote to elicit: she recently logged 30 simulated hours in ESA’s LunAres habitat as an anonymous research participant—only three people know  
- Follow-up probe: her vision for a “UN Charter for Off-World Equity” she’s drafting—potential collaboration with Planta’s think-tank wing
