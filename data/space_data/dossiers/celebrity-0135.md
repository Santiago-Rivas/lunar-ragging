### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** John Krasinski

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: Brooklyn Heights, New York & west-side Los Angeles production hub  
- Regular trans-Atlantic commute to London (spouse’s filming) and Atlanta (sound-stage for A Quiet Place III)  
- Keeps a low-profile Vermont cabin for script retreats; off-grid week each quarter  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Actor, writer, director; Co-founder, Sunday Night Productions  
- Creator/director of the $650 M global franchise “A Quiet Place” and executive producer/star of Amazon’s “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”  
- Early adopter of hybrid distribution models—partnered with Paramount+ on simultaneous theatrical/streaming releases  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Post-production on “IF” (Imaginary Friends), his first family-fantasy tent-pole, slated for holiday 2026 worldwide launch  
- Packaging a near-future thriller set on an orbital research station—seeking real space footage to differentiate from CGI  
- Building Sunday Night’s immersive-media unit: VR table reads, volumetric capture, and AI-assisted language dubbing  
- Personal: carving out 2027 summer hiatus for extended travel with daughters before they enter middle school  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur cartoonist; sketches storyboards by hand—carries a Moleskine with thick black Sharpie at events  
- Deep believer in “silence as connective tissue” (his credo from A Quiet Place) and fascinated by non-verbal communication in zero-G  
- Collects vintage NASA mission patches; sees them as reminders that “impossible timelines can still launch”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar dinner offers authentic sensory reference for his orbital thriller; intends to capture binaural audio and light-reflection data  
- Curious about psychological effects of low-gravity socializing—insights to shape character dynamics  
- Brings value as a high-visibility storyteller who can amplify Planta’s narrative of boundary-breaking human experiences  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: SpaceX’s Polaris program media liaison, ESA’s cinematic outreach team, Michelin-star chef Ana Roš (for zero-waste lunar cuisine consulting)  
- Could mentor Planta’s in-house content team on narrative framing; open to cameo roles for tech partners in upcoming projects  
- Engagement tip: Invite him to co-design a brief “silent course” during the dinner—aligns with his fascination for communication beyond speech  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid The Office small-talk; appreciates forward-looking dialogue more than nostalgia  
- Unusual trivia: nearly pursued a career in sports medicine before discovering acting at Brown—spark for any “alternative paths” conversation  
- Potential follow-up: gauge his comfort level with brief on-site filming—union approvals for SAG-AFTRA space jurisdiction are uncharted territory
