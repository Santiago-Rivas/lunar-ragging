### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Diana Beresford-Kroeger

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: 160-acre research arboretum “Carrigliath,” Merrickville, Ontario
- Maintains restored family cottage near Kilkenny, Ireland; summers spent collecting Celtic ethnobotanical lore
- Regular circuit: Ottawa → Dublin → Vancouver → Tokyo (film festivals & reforestation summits)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Independent botanist & medical biochemist; author of “The Global Forest,” “To Speak for the Trees”
- Architect of the Bioplan—framework guiding citizen-led reforestation in 31 countries
- Film subject & narrator: “Call of the Forest,” driving multi-million–tree pledges across Canada and Asia

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Building an open-access genome library of climate-resilient boreal and Celtic tree species; partnering with Ontario Genomics and Teagasc
- Piloting micro-forest “oxygen islands” near urban hospitals to test impacts on post-operative recovery
- Drafting new book “Celestial Roots” exploring how lunar gravity may influence plant morphogenesis
- Personal objective: secure long-term stewardship for Carrigliath via a living trust & Indigenous co-management board

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Plays uilleann pipes at dawn to “tune” her forest; records ultrasonic tree acoustics for research and art installations
- Guiding maxim: “If you understand a tree, you understand the world’s immune system.”
- Fascinated by Irish ogham script; keeps pocket-sized ogham stave set for spontaneous storytelling

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Thought leader on closed-loop botanical ecosystems—a core challenge for lunar habitation
- Seeking dialogue on low-gravity root anchoring techniques, mycorrhizal transport protocols, and biophilic habitat design
- Offers: Can curate a symbolic “Lunar Heritage Grove”—a collection of 12 hyper-efficient tree species chosen for carbon fixation, food, medicine, and psychological well-being of crews

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Ideal introductions: 
  • NASA’s VEGGIE/Advanced Plant Habitat team  
  • SpaceX life-support R&D leads  
  • Chef-scientists exploring phytonutrient-dense microgreens
- Ask attendees for: Access to lunar regolith simulant labs for seed germination trials; aerospace-grade LED spectrum data
- Engagement tip: Open with Celtic story of the hazel tree of wisdom, then segue to how lunar settlements need equally mythic flora

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Recently recovered from minor cardiac procedure; prefers short stints in low-oxygen or high-noise settings
- Unusual fact prompt: She was once summoned to the Vatican to advise on re-wilding the Papal Gardens—almost no one outside clergy knows
- Follow-up Qs: Status of UNESCO application to designate her arboretum a “Global Forest Memory Site”; interest in broadcasting live tree acoustics during the lunar dinner for ambient soundscape
