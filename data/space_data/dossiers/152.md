### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Brad Pitt

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Feliz compound in Los Angeles; secondary retreat at Château Miraval, Provence, France  
- Regular circuits: London & Budapest (current production hubs), Austin (F1 tech partners), Tokyo (Miraval distribution push)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-Founder & Lead Producer, Plan B Entertainment – 2× Academy Award winner for Best Picture (“12 Years a Slave,” “Moonlight”)  
- Veteran actor with >$10 B global box-office; recent on-screen roles moving to prestige/cameo territory  
- Parallel ventures: Miraval Estate Wines & forthcoming Miraval Studios relaunch; advisory stake in Hyperloop Hospitality Initiative

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Wrapping 2026 Apple/Formula-1 feature (using next-gen virtual production volume built in Surrey)  
- Overseeing Plan B’s new “Off-World Anthologies” slate—six mid-budget sci-fi dramas intended for streaming + theatrical event screenings  
- Finalizing equity share in ceramic 3-D-printing startup “KilnX” (sustainable modular housing components)  
- Personal: devoting evenings to sculptural bronze casting with British artist Thomas Houseago; aiming for first solo gallery show late 2026  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Architecture evangelist; sketches lunar habitat concepts in Moleskine—favoring arched mycelium shells and exposed titanium ribs  
- Deeply curious about isolation psychology (sparked by “Ad Astra” prep); trades notes with NASA behavioral scientists  
- Enjoys analog hobbies—pottery wheel work, vintage motorcycle restoration, and 1960s soul vinyl collecting  
- Guiding mantra: “Do the unrepeatable” – seeks experiences that cannot be franchised or replayed  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Hollywood face of expansive-humanity storytelling; his presence signals mass-appeal legitimacy to off-planet social experiences  
- Looking to:  
  • Gauge feasibility of filming a 12-minute immersive narrative short on the Moon in 2028  
  • Source partners for Miraval “Zero-G Rosé” project—fermentation trials in lunar-gravity bioreactors  
  • Trade notes on communal design languages for extraterrestrial gatherings—acoustics, scent diffusion, and light temperature in low-grav  
- Value offered: global storytelling reach, production resources, and “celebrity-as-accelerant” for public buy-in

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • Planta’s XR engineering lead (for on-site volumetric capture)  
  • ESA chef-scientist Dr. Léa Moreau (lunar fermentation lab)  
  • Builder One Ventures (modular habitat investors aligned with KilnX)  
- Attendees can assist by providing data on micro-gravity taste perception and materials supply-chain to Miraval Studios  
- Engaging him: start with hands-on demo—e.g., invite him to press a custom ceramic tile into the lunar regolith binder; pivot to comparing race-track telemetry vs. lunar rover data

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers intimate side conversations, low-key humor; avoid tabloid touchpoints or divorce history  
- Will ask others “What surprised you about yourself up here?”—prepare a reflective response  
- Follow-ups for post-event: secure NDAs for potential lunar short, and schedule Provence tasting of first “space-influenced” wine batch
