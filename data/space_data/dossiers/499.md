### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Melanie Perkins

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Sydney, Australia (Canva HQ in Surry Hills)
- Maintains pied-à-terre in San Francisco for investor relations and talent acquisition
- Quarterly “global pulse” trips: Singapore → Austin → London to sync with Canva’s largest regional hubs

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & CEO, Canva (valuation ≈ $40 B; >175 M monthly active users)
- Architect of Canva’s shift from DIY design tool to full-stack “Visual Communication Platform” for enterprises, creators, and educators
- Forbes 30U30 alumna; Australia’s youngest self-made female billionaire

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Embedding generative-AI (“Magic Studio”) deep into every Canva workflow; on pace to double AI-assisted output by Q4 2025
- Quietly laying groundwork for a 2026 dual-listing (ASX + NASDAQ) while preserving private-company culture
- Canva Foundation scaling “Give One” pledge—donating 30% equity upside to climate resilience and extreme-poverty projects
- Personal 12-month goal: build a cross-continent, female-founder angel fund; first close expected September 2025

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend kitesurfer; claims many product epiphanies happen “between gusts”
- Passionate about space-inspired design since childhood visits to Perth Observatory; collects tiny lunar meteorite fragments
- Guiding philosophy: “Empower the 99%—talent is universal, opportunity is not.”
- Keeps a “10x-audacity” journal—lists ideas that feel impossible today but inevitable in a decade

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees The First Dinner Party on the Moon as a live case study in human-centered design under extreme constraints—perfect R&D for Canva’s AR/VR collaboration suite
- Wants candid insights on psychological safety and team cohesion in micro-gravity environments
- Exploring co-branding moment: limited-edition “Lunar Template Pack” unveiled during the dinner, generated from attendee input
- Can offer Planta Network a turnkey storytelling portal—real-time visual summaries shareable to Earth-based audiences

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to: NASA Artemis mission UX leads; SpaceX Raptor materials team (for potential design-for-manufacture pilot); René Redzepi’s MAD Academy (gastronomy + sustainability think-tank)
- Attendees could assist by beta-testing Canva’s mixed-reality whiteboard during the event; feedback loop will shape 2027 public launch
- High-impact engagement tactic: ask her to sketch, on a holo-slate, “moon-born workflows” that would break Earth-based design assumptions

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Dislikes jargon-heavy futurism; responds to concrete user stories and metrics
- Usually travels with co-founder/husband Cliff Obrecht—confirm if he’s on the manifest
- Unusual talking point she rarely shares: won Australia’s national junior public-speaking title at 14—still crafts every major keynote solo
- Follow-up Q for post-event call: timeline for Canva Foundation’s first climate-tech grant round and possibilities for Planta data instrumentation support
