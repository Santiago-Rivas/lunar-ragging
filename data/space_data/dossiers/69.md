**FULL NAME:** Gloria Estefan

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Miami Beach & Vero Beach, FL (Estefan family residences and hospitality holdings)
- Regular circuits: Los Angeles (film/TV projects), New York (Broadway & finance), Madrid/Havana-adjacent locations for cultural initiatives
- Predictable travel: Quarterly wellness retreats in Arizona; keeps a flexible slot for philanthropic site visits in Latin America

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chair & Co-CEO, Estefan Enterprises (music catalog, film/TV production, hospitality, publishing)
- 7-time Grammy winner; 100 M+ records sold worldwide; Latin Music Hall of Fame inductee
- Producer-lead on Netflix 2026 doc “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You” and sequel stage musical slated for West End run

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing 40th-anniversary “Conga 2040” immersive show (holographic & zero-gravity-compatible performance modules)
- Negotiating a minority stake in Orbital Resorts Inc. to plant the first Latin-inspired lounge in low-Earth orbit
- Funding spinal-cord injury bio-electronics trials through the Gloria Estefan Foundation
- Personal project: authoring a resilience-focused memoir intertwining her 1990 tour-bus accident with insights on neuroplasticity

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur astrophotographer—owns a custom 14-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain; fascinated by lunar albedo variations
- Collects first-press Cuban vinyl; trades rare records with Jeff Bezos’s personal archivist
- Culinary hobby: experimenting with plant-based twists on traditional Cuban dishes
- Guiding maxim: “Fear is only as strong as the story you tell yourself.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a testbed for multisensory music experiences in micro-gravity; intends to demo a 90-second a cappella “Luna Conga” riff
- Seeking collaborators in spatial acoustics & haptic feedback to perfect sound propagation in low-pressure habitats
- Offers star power, cross-cultural storytelling, and a ready media apparatus to amplify Planta’s moon narrative

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Dr. Mei Ling (NASA acoustic research)  
  • Axiom Space hospitality design team  
  • SoundHound’s XR division for adaptive music engines
- Attendees can assist by sharing data on human emotional response in off-Earth dining environments; she will reciprocate with behind-the-scenes content access
- Best engagement tactic: ask about her telescope setup or her hypothesis that Latin percussion can help mitigate space travel disorientation—she lights up when science meets rhythm

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Physical comfort: prefers lumbar-support seating due to past spine injury
- Allergen alert: strawberries
- Sensitive topic: U.S.–Cuba political friction; steer conversation toward cultural bridges, not policy
- Follow-up queries: status of Orbital Resorts equity round; whether she will license “Conga 2040” VR assets to third parties
