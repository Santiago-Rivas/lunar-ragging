---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: London (St John’s Wood townhouse) with regular escapes to his East Sussex farm
- Maintains studios in Los Angeles & New York; trans-Atlantic flights every 6–8 weeks
- Tour pattern: short “burst” legs, then retreat to rural settings for writing, photography, and family time

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder, chief songwriter & bassist, The Beatles; 18× Grammy winner; two-time Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee

- Scaling Meat Free Monday into Asian school systems; exploring investment in cell-grown protein for touring crews
- Personal: curating “Eyes of the 60s-20s,” a photo book juxtaposing early Beatlemania with humanity’s push into space

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate vegetarian & environmentalist; intrigued by closed-loop agronomy for off-world habitats
- Amateur astrophotographer—travels with a custom Leica fitted with zero-G stabilizer
- Loves quick jam sessions; trademark question: “What song first made you feel weightless?”
- Guiding phrase from his father: “Put something of yourself in everything—then it can travel anywhere.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Composed an unreleased instrumental, “Orbit,” planning to debut through bone-conducting headsets during dinner
- Eager to test bass resonance & acoustic latency inside a pressurized lunar module
- Wants clarity on performance-rights law in extra-territorial venues before public release of any recording
- Offers global visibility and narrative flair to amplify Planta’s mission; open to co-producing a micro-VR documentary of the dinner

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Values introductions to: SpaceX life-support botanists, MIT Media Lab’s Space Music Cognition Group, Upside Foods’ orbital protein pilot team
- Could mentor early-stage creators on IP control & Web3 music monetization
- Best engagement: arrange a post-meal “gravity-lite jam” corner with lunar acoustic engineers; keep circle small, tech-focused

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers informal, pun-filled chat; steer clear of routine Beatles trivia—he’s future-oriented
- Mild right-ear hearing loss—seat him slightly left of center in any round-table setup
- Follow-up queries: 1) Interest in co-writing a Planta anthem; 2) Whether MPL legal counsel needs to vet lunar venue licensing
