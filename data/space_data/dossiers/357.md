- Drafting forthcoming book “Moral Machines in Terraforming Times” (Q4 2025 release)
- Personal: Training for Level 1 astronaut-candidate medical certification; aims to participate in a sub-orbital ethics experiment within 12 months

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Surprising fact: collects first-edition Golden Age sci-fi pulps—stores them in vacuum-sealed cases
- Weekend passions: underwater macro photography, charity improv shows, fostering special-needs rescue cats
- Guiding philosophy: “Power granted by algorithms must be matched by power to question them.”
- Enjoys debating governance models for off-world settlements and quoting Octavia Butler over dessert

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Planta’s lunar dinner showcases frontier social tech; Chowdhury offers the ethical framework for human–AI interaction in micro-societies
- Seeking dialogue on: establishing “Responsibility by Design” standards for extra-terrestrial communities; funding partners for a Moon-based bias observatory tied to Atlas
- Contribution: Can lead an on-site mini-workshop mapping ethical failure modes of autonomous habitat systems; compelling keynote potential on “Trust in Zero-Gravity Networks”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value introductions: NASA’s Office of Technology Transfer, European Space Agency’s Advanced Concepts Team, Omidyar Network’s Digital Rights portfolio leads

- Engagement tips: Open with sci-fi trivia or cat rescue stories; pivot to concrete questions on measuring social harm—she thrives on specific, real-world scenarios

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
