### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Michael Bloomberg

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Manhattan, NYC (Upper East Side); secondary residence in London’s Chelsea
- Routinely shuttles between New York, Washington D.C., and San Francisco on the company jet; quarterly swings through Europe & the Gulf for climate-policy summits

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & 88 % owner, Bloomberg L.P. (≈$13 B revenue)
- UN Special Envoy on Climate Ambition and Solutions; chair, C40 Cities
- Key achievements: tripled philanthropic outlays to $1.7 B annually; accelerated global coal-retirement pact covering 37 countries

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Launching a $5 B “Bloomberg Climate Tech Catalyst” fund (Q4 2025) targeting carbon-negative materials, precision-ag forestry, and methane-sensor constellations
- Finalizing Bloomberg NEXT, a browser-native terminal aimed at Gen-Z analysts; beta rolls out to 3,000 universities Sept 2025
- Personal focus: codifying a succession plan that keeps Bloomberg L.P. private yet mission-linked to climate action via a perpetual charitable trust
- Training for his first suborbital flight (booked with Blue Origin FY25) to set the stage for a 2027 orbital climate-data demo

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong pilot; keeps an immaculate 1976 Bonanza A36—still does his own pre-flight checks
- Collects vintage slide rules and mechanical calculators; believes “analog precision builds digital discipline”
- Enjoys off-grid sailing in Maine, citing “silence as the best focus group”
- Guiding philosophy: “Data clarifies, but courage decides”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a test-bed for extraterrestrial supply-chain transparency and closed-loop agriculture—vital for resilient Earth cities
- Wants candid dialogue on how micro-communities self-govern in extreme environments; researching governance models for climate-refuge enclaves
- Seeks partners for a joint Earth-to-lunar greenhouse sensor array feeding real-time dashboards into Bloomberg Green
- Brings deep press connections and financial modeling talent; can amplify Planta’s narrative to 325 K Bloomberg Terminal users

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired:  
  • Lunar-agri startups (HydroSpire, Orbital Harvest)  
  • Sovereign wealth funds in UAE & Singapore eyeing climate-tech space assets  
  • Sociologists studying confined-habitat psychology (MIT Media Lab, ESA)
- Offer attendees: pro-bono access to BloombergNEF datasets for any moon-linked sustainability pilot
- Best engagement tactic: present him with quantifiable impact metrics; follow with a provocative “What if…?” scenario to trigger story-telling

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers concise exchanges (≤90 seconds per point); carries notecards to jot ROIs mid-conversation
- Sensitive topic: has quietly redirected $400 M from political spending to methane abatement—ask how data drove that shift
- Follow-up to schedule: invitation to review Planta’s raw greenhouse telemetry before public release
