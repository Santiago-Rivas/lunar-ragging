### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Robert De Niro

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Tribeca, Manhattan; maintains residences in Gardiner (Hudson Valley) and Los Angeles
- Regularly shuttles between New York, London, and Tokyo for film shoots, Nobu openings, and Tribeca Enterprises meetings
- Known to accept “working holidays” near new hospitality sites—scouting design details personally

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & Co-Chair, Tribeca Enterprises (film festival, immersive media studio, and venture arm)
- Co-owner, Nobu Hospitality (60+ restaurants & hotels across five continents; space-savvy menu R&D underway)
- Two-time Academy Award winner; recent producing credits include climate-focused documentaries and limited-series content for Apple TV+
- Quiet LP in three sustainability-oriented VC funds (focus: regenerative agriculture, off-grid energy systems)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Fast-tracking a VR/AR storytelling division within Tribeca to capture “life beyond Earth” narratives before the 2030 commercial space-tourism wave
- Overseeing launch of Nobu Eco-Resort Barbuda (fully solar, reef-rebuilding mandate) slated for late 2026
- Developing autobiographical documentary on his father’s art legacy; seeking avant-garde exhibition spaces that blend film, painting, and holography
- Personal: navigating fatherhood again with newborn Gia; scheduling projects to allow extended NYC stays through 2027

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Keeps a private sketchbook—draws architectural concepts for hypothetical restaurants on Mars (“Just in case”)
- Enjoys night-sky astrophotography from upstate observatory; owns custom 14-inch telescope
- Guiding credo: “Truth in the small details sells the big story.”
- Collects vintage mechanical watches—prefers pieces that survived extreme environments (polar expeditions, deep-sea dives)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Arrived to gauge whether cinematic documentation of a lunar dinner can anchor Tribeca’s first off-world film category
- Curious about lunar-grown produce flavor profiles for future Nobu tasting menus
- Seeking candid conversations on human psychology in confined, high-tech habitats—material for upcoming space-thriller he’s executive-producing
- Offers cross-industry cachet: can amplify the event via Tribeca channels, A-list networks, and Nobu’s global clientele

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: SpaceX Starship customer experience team; MIT Media Lab’s Space Exploration Initiative; Michelin-star chefs experimenting with zero-gravity cooking
- Attendees could help by sharing data on closed-loop food systems, lunar waste-to-energy prototypes, and immersive capture rigs suitable for low-G
- Best engagement tactic: Invite him to a behind-the-scenes walk-through of the lunar kitchen, then ask his opinion on visual storytelling angles—he’ll transition naturally into collaboration talk

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers authenticity over fanfare; address him as “Bob” once rapport forms
- Opening ice-breaker: discuss his lesser-known astrophotography hobby or inquire about sketches of space-inspired restaurant interiors
- Avoid small talk on U.S. partisan politics unless he raises it; he tires of being prompted for headline quotes
- Follow-up items: potential Tribeca–Planta partnership for post-event immersive exhibit; share high-resolution stills of lunar dinner for watch-brand sponsorship pitch
