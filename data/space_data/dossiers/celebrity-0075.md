### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Sam Smith

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: North London home studio & West Hollywood apartment
- Regular circuits: New York (songwriting camps), Reykjavík (wellness retreats), Ibiza (annual songwriting+well-being getaway)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Multi-platinum, four-time Grammy-winning recording artist; non-binary advocate using they/them pronouns
- Founder, Velvet Halo Productions—independent label + multimedia studio for immersive performance projects
- Recent milestone: “Gloria” world tour grossed $160 M, pioneering on-stage volumetric capture for metaverse simulcasts

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Composing fifth studio album themed around “Humanity Off-World”—aiming to integrate binaural recordings captured in low-gravity training flights
- Building a charitable initiative, Queer Orbit, to fund LGBTQIA+ mental-health services in rural areas
- Personal ambition: complete private sub-orbital flight by mid-2026 as research for space-inspired stage design

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Classically trained in jazz vocals; secretly collects 1930s Billie Holiday acetates
- Keeps a pocket notebook of celestial sketches—self-taught astral artist
- Cooking therapy: experiments with plant-based adaptations of traditional Yorkshire dishes; proud of a zero-gravity Yorkshire pudding recipe
- Guiding philosophy: “Vulnerability is a superpower; sing the truth even if your voice shakes.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the lunar dinner as artistic R&D for album visuals and potential live broadcast from the Moon’s “quiet side” (captures Earthrise backdrop)
- Wants candid dialogue on how altered gravity affects vocal resonance and audience emotion
- Offers: In-event acoustic set tailored to lunar acoustics; willing to co-create a signature audio experience for Planta’s platform

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable intros: 
  • Planta’s XR audio engineering team for spatial-sound collaboration  
  • Artemis Hospitality Group to explore in-orbit concert series  
  • Climate-tech investors interested in funding Queer Orbit’s sustainability arm
- Engagement tips: Ask about their sketchbook or sub-orbital breathing techniques; invite them to test a prototype resonance chamber—hands-on demos trump slides
- Post-event leverage: Offer a follow-up studio day using Planta’s mixed-reality capture rigs in London

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Pronoun respect is non-negotiable; misgendering shuts conversation down
- Sensitive about tabloid narratives on body image—frame wellness questions around vocal performance, not appearance
- Surprising tidbit to elicit: Sam once finished a wilderness survival course in Iceland with zero social media for ten days—shaped their current digital-balance ethos
- Future probe: gauge interest in co-authoring a children’s book on inclusivity set on the Moon
