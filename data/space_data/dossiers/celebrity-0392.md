### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Brewster Kahle

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: San Francisco, CA (Presidio headquarters of Internet Archive)
- Maintains a converted 19th-century church in Richmond District as personal prototype of a “universal library”
- Regular circuits: Washington, DC (policy), Geneva (WIPO), Cambridge, MA (MIT Digital Preservation Lab)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Digital Librarian, Internet Archive (IA) — 99 PB of cultural data preserved, 1.9 B daily queries
- Co-founder, Alexa Internet (acq. by Amazon), Thinking Machines veteran; serial advocate for open knowledge & decentralized web
- Key achievements: Launched OpenLibrary; drove “Controlled Digital Lending” legal doctrine; 2024 recipient of ACM Software System Award for the Wayback Machine

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling IA’s Distributed Storage Grid: moving from 3 to 12 geographically and jurisdictionally diverse nodes to hedge against geopolitical risk
- Piloting “Memory Capsules” — tamper-proof, radiation-hardened SD-card-sized archives for off-planet repositories (perfect lunar talking point)
- Fundraising $80 M endowment to guarantee 500-year operational horizon; courting impact-oriented crypto and space-tech donors
- Personal: perfecting home-built pipe-organ-driven music server; writing a manifesto on “Civilization’s Shadow Libraries” for 2026 publication

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur machinist; collects and restores 1920s linotype presses to pair print permanence with digital ephemera
- Surprising fact: spent summers in college building solar ovens in rural Kenya—still prototypes solar-powered “offline libraries” in his backyard
- Guiding credo: “Universal access to all knowledge is a civil right, not a convenience”
- Enjoys speculative fiction; recently re-read Arthur C. Clarke’s “A Fall of Moondust” to critique archival accuracy on lunar life

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: champion of long-term, off-world cultural preservation—aligns with Planta’s vision of extending human connection beyond Earth
- Seeks dialogue on installing a redundant IA node beneath the Sea of Tranquility habitat; needs partners for radiation shielding and power
- Offers thought leadership on designing user-centric, privacy-respecting data systems for extraterrestrial communities

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: SpaceX Starlink policy team (lunar bandwidth); Blue Origin’s Club for the Future (education); UNESCO “Memory of the World” Programme directors
- Attendees can help by pledging digital collections, granting excess satellite capacity, or sponsoring Memory Capsules
- Engagement tips: ask about his “bookmobiles that beam from space” concept; invite him to brainstorm zero-gravity card-catalog interfaces

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers conversational depth over small talk; phrase queries as “how might we…?” challenges
- Mild hearing loss in left ear—standing on his right improves clarity in noisy settings
- Possible follow-up: his view on AI-generated texts entering the archive; gauge openness to co-authoring an interplanetary archiving white paper
