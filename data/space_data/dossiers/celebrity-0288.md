### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Melinda French Gates

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Seattle, WA; maintains pied-à-terre in Washington, D.C. for policy work
- Monthly swings through New York & San Francisco for board meetings and Pivotal Ventures portfolio reviews
- Quiet pattern of quarterly field visits to Sub-Saharan Africa and India tied to maternal-health pilots

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Managing Partner, Pivotal Ventures (gender-focused investment and incubation platform, est. 2015)
- Co-chair, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (responsible for $9 B annual grant-making; leads women’s empowerment, global health innovation, and U.S. education initiatives)
- Recent highlight: Orchestrated the $1.3 B “Equality Can’t Wait” coalition to accelerate women’s economic power in the U.S.

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing a $500 M “Tech & Trust” fund inside Pivotal to back companies building AI tools that advance reproductive health, caregiving efficiency, and political participation
- Championing a global data standard for measuring unpaid care work—aims for G-20 adoption by 2026
- Personally exploring space-health research after funding a University of Washington study on bone-density loss in female astronauts
- On a more personal note, taking intensive Italian cooking classes in preparation for an upcoming Sicilian sabbatical with her three adult children

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate amateur photographer—keeps a Leica M11 in her travel bag to document women entrepreneurs she meets in the field
- Maintains a 20-year tradition of weekly meditation walks; credits them for her “listen first, fund second” philosophy
- Favorite guiding line: “Measure the moments, not the monuments.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending to evaluate how lunar-habitat tech can translate into resilient infrastructure for low-resource regions on Earth (water recycling, closed-loop agriculture)
- Seeks candid perspectives on ensuring gender-balanced crew selection and governance as private lunar projects scale
- Can offer strategic capital plus convening power for any consortium tackling “space for social good” initiatives

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Artemis diversity office, SpaceX Raptor sustainability team, and UNESCO’s Space Education program
- Would welcome a brief, data-rich demo from Planta engineers on their biometric social-connection platform (“how do you verify consent in zero-G?” is her core question)
- Optimal engagement: small-group discussion over dessert—she dislikes loud cocktail setups; responds well to pointed questions framed around measurable outcomes

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: divorce settlement finalized 2023; avoid references to Bill’s ongoing AI ventures unless she raises them
- Follow-up queries: (1) interest level in co-authoring an op-ed on inclusive space policy; (2) willingness to seed a women-led “Lunar Impact Fund” alongside Planta Network
- Conversation goal cue: ask, “What surprised you most about studying space-health data?”—aligns with host’s prompt on unexpected personal insights
