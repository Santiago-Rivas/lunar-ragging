### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Thomas Müller

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Munich, Germany (family home in Bogenhausen)
- Seasonal stays in Lisbon (off-season sailing hub) and occasional residencies in New York for sports-tech board meetings
- Pattern: ~10 days per month on the road with FC Bayern or sponsorship shoots; uses downtime for rapid “learning sprints” in ag-tech and XR media

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Vice-captain & forward, FC Bayern München; 12 Bundesliga titles, 2 UEFA Champions League wins, 2014 World Cup champion
- Co-founder, SpielFeld Ventures — early-stage fund focused on fan-engagement tech, biomechatronics, and sustainable performance nutrition
- UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador; leads “Kick4Kids” digital literacy program across Sub-Saharan Africa

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Transition blueprint: completing UEFA A-license while assembling staff for an analytics-heavy coaching career slated for 2027–28 season
- SpielFeld raising €85 M Opportunity Fund II; scouting XR platforms that bring stadium atmosphere to micro-gravity environments (perfect lunar tie-in)
- Personal quest: mastering conversational Mandarin ahead of 2026 Club World Cup expansion

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Unusual hobby: breeds Upper Bavarian dressage horses; experiments with low-gravity equine biomechanics simulations
- Philosophical anchor: “Spielintelligenz beats raw power” — sees life as rapid pattern recognition, seeks crossover lessons from chess-AI and swarm robotics
- Collects vintage NASA mission patches; intrigued by Apollo 12’s improvisational problem-solving ethos

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: global sports icon with mass-market storytelling power; can translate lunar experience into mainstream enthusiasm
- Seeking: co-creation partners for a mixed-reality documentary “Zero-G Football: Redefining the Beautiful Game on the Moon”
- Contribution: willingness to stage a micro-match demo in the habitat, highlighting human coordination in low gravity and seeding social-media virality

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Intros desired to: 
  • Planta’s sensory-tech R&D lead (to test haptic jersey prototypes)  
  • Space-certified nutrition startups incorporating biofermented Bavarian oats  
  • XR distribution chiefs at Netflix or Apple Vision for the documentary pitch
- Ways to help him: share data on human vestibular adaptation during short-stay lunar visits; offer studio-grade capture equipment for sports visualization
- Engagement tips: open with off-beat trivia (e.g., Apollo astronauts smuggled a soccer ball sketch into mission logs); invite him to design a custom lunar corner-flag for the dinner table centerpiece

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: knee cartilage maintenance regimen is proprietary; avoid pressing for medical specifics
- Follow-up Qs: status of Bayern’s internal NFT fan-token pivot; interest level in co-hosting a post-event Earth-orbit charity match
