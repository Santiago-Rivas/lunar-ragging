### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Alan Lightman

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Cambridge, MA; summer writing retreat on a small island off the Maine coast  
- Predictable travel loop: Cambodia twice yearly (Harpswell Foundation), West Coast & London for literary festivals, occasional NASA-JPL visits when consulting on science-communication projects  
- Prefers 3–4-day stays, always books first outbound flight at dawn to maximize quiet writing hours  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Physicist-turned-novelist; Professor of the Practice, Humanities & Physics, MIT (now emeritus status but still supervising one interdisciplinary lab seminar)  
- Author of 9 novels and 6 essay collections—Einstein’s Dreams translated into 40+ languages, still sells ~25 k copies/yr  
- Founder, Harpswell Foundation—has mentored 2,700+ Southeast Asian women leaders; MacArthur “genius grant” finalist short-list (was quietly disappointed not to win)  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Final edits on “Moonwalking Minds” (Knopf, 2026), an essay cycle examining cognition in low-gravity environments—seeking fresh sensory detail during the lunar dinner  
- Co-creating a PBS miniseries, “Cosmic Intimacy,” exploring how personal narratives shift as humanity expands off-planet; filming begins Q4 2025  
- Building an endowed fellowship that pairs young Cambodian women with space-industry internships; target launch 2027 cohort  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Restores wooden sailboats; claims varnishing hulls teaches patience better than any meditation app  
- Plays jazz piano at speakeasy bars under the pseudonym “Al Nico”—keeps this largely under wraps (conversation gold)  
- Guiding maxim: “Wonder is the bridge between rigor and reverence.” Views science-art fusion as civilization’s next competitive edge  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending to harvest real lunar sensory data—sound dampening, horizon color shifts, food texture changes—for Chapter 1 of new book  
- Wants candid dialogue on ethical storytelling: how to avoid turning the Moon into “the next backdrop for shallow influencer content”  
- Can contribute a live micro-lecture weaving lunar tidal physics with human emotional cycles; Planta’s media team eager to capture it  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: 1) SpaceX Starship life-support engineers, 2) Unity & Unreal Engine execs exploring high-fidelity lunar VR, 3) Philanthropists funding STEM equity for women in developing nations  
- Attendees can assist by offering short audio diaries describing their first minute of lunar awe—material for his PBS series  
- Engage him with open-ended questions about consciousness in altered gravity; invite him to the quiet observation dome at 02:00 LT when Earthrise is visible—he will not refuse  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Low tolerance for jargon-heavy tech pitches; prefers metaphor-rich conversation  
- Habitually pockets small stones or objects from meaningful sites—will likely look for a discreet moon pebble; advise on collection protocols  
- Follow-up queries: status of his planned visiting-artist residency on Axiom Station, and whether Harpswell lunar internship fund has secured anchor donor yet
