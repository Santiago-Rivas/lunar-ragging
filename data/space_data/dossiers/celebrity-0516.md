### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Robin Wall Kimmerer

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Syracuse, NY (SUNY College of Environmental Science & Forestry)
- Keeps a rustic cabin on ancestral Onondaga lands; retreats there for writing sabbaticals
- Annual migration circuit: Pacific Northwest (Salish Kwe Gardens), Great Lakes tribal councils, COP climate summits, and now NASA’s Artemis stakeholder sessions in Houston

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Distinguished Professor of Environmental Biology & Director, Center for Native Peoples and the Environment
- Author: “Braiding Sweetgrass” (3 M+ copies, 40+ languages) and forthcoming sequel “Planet of Relatives” (Spring 2026)
- MacArthur Fellow 2024; consults for USDA, Smithsonian, and Blue Origin’s regenerative-habitat program

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing a policy brief on Indigenous reciprocity principles for off-world settlement, commissioned by the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs
- Co-leading SeedSongs, a moon-shot experiment testing polyculture seed viability under 1/6 g (launch scheduled mid-2027)
- Personal goal: digitize family’s Potawatomi star-lore manuscripts before elders’ oral history is lost
- Exploring immersive storytelling formats (spatial audio + VR) to teach “rights of nature” in classrooms worldwide

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur cedar-flute maker; believes instruments carved at lunar gravity could create “new physics of sound”
- Evening skywatcher—tracks lunar phases with a hand-notched hickory stick she’s carried for 30 years
- Guiding maxim: “All flourishing is mutual.” Sees the Moon not as a resource but as “our oldest teacher in patience and tide.”
- Surprising fact she enjoys sharing: was a teenage science-fiction illustrator, once sold concept art to Omni magazine

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Brings a botanist’s lens on closed-loop life-support and holistic design of lunar habitats
- Seeking dialogue on: ethical governance frameworks, biodiversity banking for space voyages, and poetic rituals to mark humanity’s first extraterrestrial meal
- Will offer a short “thanksgiving address” in English & Potawatomi to open dinner, grounding the gathering in gratitude

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: 
  • Planta Network’s bio-engineers refining photobioreactors  
  • ESA’s MELiSSA team on waste-to-food loops  
  • Impact investors funding Indigenous-led climate tech
- Attendees can assist by sharing sensor data from lunar ag trials and by partnering on an interactive lunar-earth seed exchange exhibition
- Best engagement: invite her to taste-test leaf crops grown in lunar simulant and discuss flavor-chemistry changes under reduced gravity

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Conversational tempo: reflective; appreciates a moment of silence before reply—avoid rapid-fire questioning
- Zero tolerance for language framing nature or the Moon as “dead” or “raw material”
- Follow-up questions:  
  1. Status of SeedSongs launch vehicle slot (SpaceX vs. Blue Origin)  
  2. Whether she’d co-author a Planta white paper on “Reciprocal Design for Off-World Dining Spaces”
