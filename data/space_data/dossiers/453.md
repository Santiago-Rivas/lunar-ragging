### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Hjalmar Nilsonne

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Stockholm, Sweden  
- Secondary base: Berlin tech hub (sq-ft sub-lease inside EUREF Campus)  
- Commutes monthly to London & Brussels for policy consultations on EU carbon-neutral grids  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Executive Chair, Watty (acquired 2024 by Egain Group; retains R&D skunk-works unit)  
- Venture Partner, Polar Night Capital—€150 M climate-tech seed fund focused on hard-science hardware  
- Board advisor, Volvo Energy’s “Vehicle-to-Everything” (V2X) taskforce  
- Key achievements: patented edge-AI chip that identifies appliance-level energy signatures from a single sensor; secured Sweden’s first residential demand-flexibility subsidy (2023)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Spinning out “Watty LUNAR,” a micro-grid telemetry kit designed for regolith-shielded habitats and low-gravity machinery  
- Raising a $40 M Series A for PhotonBas, a startup tackling battery second-life diagnostics with hyperspectral cameras  
- Drafting white-paper for EU “Kilowatt Transparency Act,” aiming to standardise appliance-level data access by 2028  
- Personal: training for an Arctic ultra-marathon; intends to turn biometric data into open human-performance dataset

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend luthier—hand-crafts Scandinavian nyckelharpas, believes wood resonance parallels power-grid harmonics  
- Keeps a 200-year-old captain’s log from a distant relative; practices “future history” journaling every Sunday  
- Guiding philosophy: “Invisible systems shape visible behaviour—measure them or stay blind.”  
- Surprising fact: flew his own home-built electric paramotor over Lapland’s midnight sun to test thermal batteries in ‑15 °C

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: pioneering real-time energy analytics critical for sustainable lunar habitats  
- Seeks: collaborators on low-gravity thermal management, food-production energy modelling, and sovereign data layers for off-Earth colonies  
- Brings: proven field experience miniaturising sensors, policy leverage within EU, and a narrative that bridges climate tech to space exploration

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX Starship life-support team, JAXA’s Smart Energy Module group, and chef-scientist collective MAD (for food-energy co-design)  
- Attendees can help by sharing sensor logistics for extreme environments or connecting him to lunar regolith 3D-printing projects  
- Engage him by asking about instrument resonance in low gravity or the metabolic cost of moon-based agriculture—he lights up when tech meets art

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers concise numbers first, story later; disdains “green theatre” proclamations without KPIs  
- Sensitive: acquired Watty IP still entangled in one pending opposition in Germany—avoid public discussion  
- Follow-up Qs for deeper rapport: status of his open biometric dataset, and whether Watty LUNAR is pursuing ESA flight qualification
