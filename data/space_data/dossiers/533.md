### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: Boston/Cambridge, MA (MIT CSAIL) and London (University of Oxford visiting professorship)
- Quarterly circuit: Geneva for CERN advisory boards, Brussels for EU digital-rights sessions, Singapore & Nairobi for Solid pilot deployments

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & CTO, Inrupt Inc. — commercial steward of the Solid decentralised-data platform
- Director, World Wide Web Consortium (W3C); initiator, “Contract for the Web” global policy framework
- Inventor of the World Wide Web; recipient of Turing Award, Millennium Technology Prize, and Olympic honor “This Is For Everyone” (2012)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling national-level Solid “data pods” with NHS England and the Government of Flanders
- Drafting open standards for cislunar networking to ensure interoperability across Artemis, Gateway, and private stations
- Quietly fundraising a $60 M Series B for Inrupt; looking for strategic investors who share a pro-user data ethos
- Personally exploring AI-assisted web protocols that embed provenance and trust at the packet layer (working name: “Web5”)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong railway enthusiast; maintains a hand-built model of the 1930s Brighton Belle in his Cambridge basement
- Recreational scuba diver—draws parallels between under-sea exploration and off-planet habitats (“both depend on life-supporting data flows”)
- Guiding maxim: “The web is a social invention, not a technical one.”
- Unusual trivia he enjoys sharing: as a student he engineered a programmable LED juggling club for late-night street performances in Oxford

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar dinner offers showcase venue for open standards discourse: wants to seed a “Lunar Web Consortium” before commercial silos form
- Seeking candid talks with space-telecom providers on latency compensation algorithms and spectrum governance
- Will contribute thought-leadership on user-owned identity layers for off-world communities; can demo a Solid pod running on a radiation-hardened Raspberry Pi

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: Starlink/SpaceX Starshield policy team, ESA’s Moonlight project leads, and venture arms of JAXA & Blue Origin
- Attendees can help by pledging data-sharing pilots or offering testbeds in analog habitats (e.g., HI-SEAS, LunAres)
- Best engagement tactic: propose a concrete interoperability puzzle, then invite him to sketch a protocol on a napkin—he loves rapid white-boarding

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers low-key settings over spotlight grandstanding; a quiet corner of the lunar observatory domes will suit deeper dialogue
- Sensitive to “founder of the web” hero worship—focus on future challenges, not past accolades
- Follow-up areas: (1) governance model for Lunar Web Consortium funding, (2) timeline for open-source release of Web5 provenance layer
