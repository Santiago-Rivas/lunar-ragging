### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: coastal home in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland  
- Secondary writing retreat in Silver Lake, Los Angeles

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Writing fourth studio album (working title: “Celestial Bodies”) incorporating field recordings of tidal movements and NASA archival audio
- Building an immersive Dolby Atmos + WebXR live-show format for 2026 world tour; seeking tech collaborators to perfect low-gravity audio modeling
- Launching the “Seedling Sessions” initiative—carbon-negative pop-up concerts that fund rewilding projects in Ireland and Appalachia
- Personal focus: deepening knowledge of regenerative agriculture; experimenting with lunar-soil simulants to test possibilities for heritage seed growth off-planet

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Off-stage hobbies: archery, handcrafted effects-pedal circuitry, and amateur mycology (cultivates oyster mushrooms in shipping containers)
- Keeps notebooks of obscure medieval Irish poetry; quotes Seamus Heaney in conversation
- Guiding view: “Art should be a rehearsal for empathy”; believes music in new frontiers (space, VR) can reset public attention on Earth’s fragility
- Unusual fact for conversation goal: has perfect pitch for birdsong—can identify >120 European bird calls and occasionally works them into vocal warm-ups

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to The First Dinner Party on the Moon as a testbed for his spatial-audio ambitions and to symbolically launch the next record cycle
- Seeking:  
  • Acoustic data on lunar habitat resonance for pre-mixing tracks  
  • Storytelling partners to weave ecological narratives into Planta’s social-tech platform  
- Contribution: intimate acoustic set in partial gravity, interactive “call-and-response” between Earth livestream and lunar audience

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX Starship acoustics team lead; Dolby Labs Immersive R&D; Patagonia’s environmental impact fund manager
- Attendees can assist by sharing sensor recordings of environmental sounds from extreme habitats (deserts, deep sea, polar) for album sampling
- Meaningful engagement tips: discuss heritage seeds, lunar agriculture ethics, or offer a quick demo of any innovative wearable audio tech

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers one-on-one or small-circle chats; guards private life—avoid probing romantic topics
- Does not drink hard liquor; enjoys single-origin coffee—knowing this builds rapport
- Follow-up question: interest in joining Planta’s Artistic Advisory Board and co-designing a post-event digital experience that blends music, mycology, and lunar imagery
