### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Iris van Herpen

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Amsterdam studio (400-year-old former theatre on the Herengracht)
- Secondary presence in Paris during couture season; short research residencies in Tokyo & Boston (MIT Media Lab)
- Accepts most public appearances only if they intersect with tech-forward sustainability themes—averages 2–3 keynote trips per quarter

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Artistic Director, Iris van Herpen Haute Couture (member of Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode)
- Pioneer of 3D-printed and biomimetic couture; first to send fully 3D-printed dress down a Paris runway (2011)
- Collaborations: CERN (subatomic particle visualization garments), ESA concept suit for micro-gravity comfort, and stage wardrobes for Björk, Grimes, Cate Blanchett

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Developing “LUCID” collection—garments grown from mycelium filaments cultured in zero-oxygen chambers; scheduled for July 2026 couture week
- Co-leading EU Horizon grant on closed-loop textile ecosystems for off-planet habitats
- Personal ambition: complete parabolic-flight certification to test fluid-draping behavior in micro-gravity by Q3 2025
- Publishing first monograph, “Symbiotic Skins,” with Taschen (early 2027) featuring AR overlays

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Practices silent freediving; credits breath-based meditations for many design breakthroughs
- Fascinated by synesthesia research—she sketches after listening to astrophysicist playlists of pulsar data
- Guiding philosophy: “Nature is not inspiration; it is instruction.”
- Collects small meteorite fragments; uses them as pattern weights on cutting tables

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Designs sit at intersection of art, science & space; her adaptive fabrics could illustrate Planta’s vision of multisensory social wearables in low-gravity dining
- Seeking: Real-time haptic feedback systems that could be woven into couture for immersive storytelling; partners with lunar habitat materials labs to test mycelium-based textiles against radiation
- Contribution: Can curate a micro-gravity haute-couture capsule for the event, visually embodying Planta’s “uncommon commonalities” theme

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Dr. Zoe Kim (Dynatex Radiation Coatings) for fabric shielding  
  • Chef-cosmologist Davide Carbone for edible biopolymers aligning with her “wear-then-eat” concept  
  • XR maestro Kei Nakamura for integrating gesture-controlled light patterns into garments
- How attendees can help: Investor interest in scaling bio-fabrication lab; beta testers for zero-G garment ergonomics
- Engaging her: Ask about the acoustic properties of silk in vacuum or share obscure marine invertebrate morphologies—she keeps a sketchbook handy for spontaneous co-design

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Quietly evaluating minority equity sale (≤20 %) to fund in-house 4D-printing facility; prefers partners who allow artistic autonomy
- Surprising fact prompt: She originally trained as a competitive fencer, which influences her obsession with kinetic silhouettes
- Follow-up Qs:  
  1. Status of ESA safety certification for mycelium textiles  
  2. Interest level in co-authoring a white paper on “Emotion-Centric Spacesuits” with Planta’s R&D team
