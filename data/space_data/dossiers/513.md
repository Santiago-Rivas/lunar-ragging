### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Phoebe Waller-Bridge

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: North London townhouse overlooking Regent’s Canal
- Secondary crash-pad in Los Feliz, LA for writers’ room sprints
- Pattern: six-week Pendolino cycle—London → LA → NYC → back for Edinburgh family weekends

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Creator & star, “Fleabag”; executive producer, “Killing Eve” (BAFTA & Emmy wins)
- Co-writer, “No Time To Die”; lead/producer, “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny”
- Multi-year overall deal with Amazon Studios; showrunner of upcoming “Tomb Raider” series

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing Tomb Raider season-one bible; casting locked by Oct 2025
- Piloting an interactive XR miniseries (“Gallows Humour”) that merges volumetric capture with live improv—prototype tests at Pinewood’s XR Stage this autumn
- Negotiating first feature as director—darkly comic sci-fi set in orbital quarantine (script polish due Dec 2025)
- Personally: taking intensive zero-G training at Cologne ESA facility—material for both the XR piece and Tonight Show anecdote
- Six-month goal: deepen creative tech literacy (Unity, generative story tools) to cut reliance on external labs

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Secret tinkerer: collects early 1900s clockwork automata; enjoys repairing gears to “hear stories click”
- Plays jazz piano late nights; claims minor-key changes unlock emotional punchlines
- Guiding maxim: “Embarrassment is a compass—run toward the blush.”
- Fascinated by how weightlessness alters comedic timing and eye contact; already drafting a lunar dining sketch

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a live testbed for immersive narrative—sees the lunar base as “the ultimate fourth wall break”
- Seeking on-site engineers willing to brainstorm real-time audience POV switches between Moon & Earth streams
- Offers: agile script doctoring, spontaneous hosting bits, and an audio diary segment for Planta’s archival capsule

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: NASA Public Engagement lead; Epic Games Creative Tech team; Michelin-star chef Dominique Crenn (for sensory-narrative pairing)
- Attendees can assist with: low-latency comms APIs, licensing lunar footage for Amazon tie-ins, female-led VFX houses
- Engagement tips: Skip rehearsed pitches—ask what made her laugh recently or show her a quirky gadget; she’ll riff immediately

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers conversations standing up, coffee in hand—keeps energy high
- Politely avoids politics on-record; off-record, candid and unfiltered
- Surprising fact prompt: she once interned as a funeral home makeup artist—uses that memory bank for character depth
- Follow-up angle: invite her to narrate a short “Moonlog” podcast episode en route back to Earth
