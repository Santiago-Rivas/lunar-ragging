### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jean Liu

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Beijing HQ of DiDi Global
- Maintains apartments in Shanghai and Singapore; quarterly swings through Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv for autonomous-tech scouting
- Recent uptick in travel to Shenzhen & Hefei for EV battery supply negotiations

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- President, DiDi Global; steered company through $25 B Series Funding, global MAUs > 550 M
- Board member, Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and Tsinghua x-Lab
- Known for brokering China’s first major ride-hailing data-sharing pact with municipal planners

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Fast-tracking L4 autonomous robo-taxi rollout in select Chinese cities by Q4 2026
- Building “DiDi Orbit” – an R&D skunkworks exploring sub-orbital and lunar surface mobility logistics
- Personal: championing DiDi’s breast-cancer early-screening program for 1 M female drivers by 2027
- Exploring family relocation flexibility to enable teens’ IB program enrollment abroad; education futurism matters to her

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Plays professional-level classical piano; records nocturnes to test in-car acoustic algorithms
- Passionate about astrophotography—owns a custom Celestron rig on a remote Xinjiang farm
- Guiding maxim: “Infrastructure is destiny—build rails first, apps later.”
- Secret fascination with Victorian era mechanical keyboards; travels with a 1920s folding Corona for offline note-taking

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees lunar dinner as live sandbox to model high-constraint mobility networks (closed oxygen loop = extreme urban density)
- Wants dialogue on ultra-low-latency comms enabling tele-operated fleets between Earth and Moon
- Brings playbook on scaling multi-modal platforms & behavioral incentives; eager to compare with off-world habitation design
- Hopes to test DiDi Orbit concept sketches with robotics, habitat architects, and space-policy strategists

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable introductions: Starship propulsion team lead (SpaceX), Nokia Bell Labs lunar 4G project manager, ESA life-support systems chief
- Could offer attendees pilot seats in DiDi’s autonomous fleet sandbox in Guangzhou for data-sharing collaborations
- Best engagement tactic: present a specific, measurable use-case (e.g., “10-rover last-mile cargo loop for lunar hydroponics”)—she gravitates to concrete metrics

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid dwelling on 2021 cybersecurity probe; she redirects to forward-looking transparency reforms
- Time-boxed conversationalist—prefers 3-minute idea sprints then follow-up in writing
- Potential follow-up: inquire about funding structure for DiDi Orbit—equity carve-out vs. sovereign partnerships
