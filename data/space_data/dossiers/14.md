### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Neri Oxman

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Manhattan, NY (studio headquarters)  
- Secondary base: Cambridge, MA for MIT collaborations; quarterly trips to Tel Aviv & Zürich to oversee material-lab pilots  
- Routinely schedules two-week “field sprints” in extreme environments (deserts, reefs, Arctic stations) to test living-material prototypes

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Chief Creative Officer, OXMAN—an R&D practice fusing architecture, biology, and advanced fabrication  
- Former MIT Media Lab professor; coined the discipline “Material Ecology”  
- Select accolades: Cooper Hewitt National Design Award, National Geographic Emerging Explorer, works in MoMA & Pompidou permanent collections  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling “Silk Pavilion 3.0,” an autonomous habitat grown by silkworm colonies for off-planet construction; NASA grant delivers demo module by Q4 2026  
- Finalizing investor consortium for a Series A spin-out focused on mycelium-based carbon-negative panels (pilot factory outside Albany, NY)  
- Curating “Symbiosis Futures” exhibit (Guggenheim, spring 2026) featuring regenerative design for lunar & Martian settlements  
- Personally studying deep-sea cephalopod locomotion to inspire adaptive soft-robotic joints—eyeing a patent filing within 12 months  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Keeps a pocket-sized haiku journal; writes one poem per flight ascent to “frame liminal moments”  
- Morning ritual: 20-minute cello improvisation to calibrate creative flow  
- Guiding premise: “Design nature, naturally”—human systems should be grown, not assembled  
- Fascinated by multi-sensory dining; has experimented with edible scaffolds that change flavor when exposed to lunar-gravity analogues  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Directly relevant through lunar habitat research and sensory-design expertise; keen to experience how micro-gravity alters taste, scent, and social cues  
- Seeking collaborators with closed-loop life-support tech and zero-waste culinary processes to integrate into Silk Pavilion habitats  
- Offers unique contribution: concept sketches for ultra-light dining spaces grown in-situ from fungal mycelia and regolith-reinforced chitin  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to:  
  • SpaceX in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) team  
  • Chef Dominique Crenn (food texture experiments)  
  • European Space Agency’s MELiSSA bioregenerative life-support program  
- Attendees can assist by sharing data on human circadian response to 1/6 g environments—critical for her habitat lighting algorithms  
- Engagement tip: Ask about her octopus-inspired joint research; she lights up when connecting marine biology to space architecture  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers exploratory dialogue over polished pitches; bring an open-ended question rather than a slide deck  
- Sensitive topic: She guards family privacy—avoid mentioning high-profile spouse and children unless she volunteers  
- Follow-up questions to consider:  
  • What material surprised her most during lunar-regolith composites testing?  
  • Unusual or surprising fact she hasn’t shared publicly—likely tied to her haiku practice or deep-sea dives; prime opportunity to meet the conversation goal.
