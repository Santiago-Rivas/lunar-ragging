### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Arthur Zang

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Yaoundé, Cameroon
- Secondary touch-down hubs: Paris & San Francisco for R&D partnerships and investor meetings
- Travel rhythm: Two weeks per quarter across West/East Africa setting up tele-cardiology centers; annual swing through Bay Area for health-tech capital; 2026 schedule now includes two parabolic-flight campaigns in Bordeaux for micro-gravity prototype testing

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, CardioPad Global (re-branded from Himore Medical Equipment in 2024)
- Inventor of the CardioPad tablet—first mobile ECG/AI-analysis device built and manufactured in Africa; deployed in 14 countries, >3 M patient screenings logged
- Awards & influence: Rolex Award for Enterprise, Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation, WHO Digital Health Advisory Council member

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a $55 M Series B to scale satellite-linked cardiac diagnostics for ultra-remote environments (islands, oil rigs, Antarctic bases—lunar habitats next)
- Building “CardioPad L-X” line: radiation-hardened, glove-friendly interface, blood-oxygen & arrhythmia alerts optimized for partial-gravity physiology
- Personal 12-month quest: secure ESA & NASA validation data sets, publish in The Lancet Planetary Health; complete night-school piano diploma before 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Self-taught classical pianist; composes short nocturnes inspired by African lullabies—brings a foldable silicone keyboard on work trips
- Amateur astrophotographer; built his first Newtonian reflector from recycled bike rims at 16
- Guiding maxim: “Innovation is born where resources are scarce and stakes are high.”
- Reads sci-fi for design cues—favorite author Liu Cixin; intrigued by organ-on-chip concepts for space

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- At the dinner to test live biometric streaming from the lunar base and scope partners for pilot trials of CardioPad L-X
- Wants candid stories on coping with isolation in space; gathering qualitative data for a mental-health adjunct module
- Offers: can run real-time ECG demos on guests, provide visceral proof of tech’s readiness, and share lessons on frugal innovation applicable to off-world living

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Human Research Program, Axiom Space medical ops, SpaceX Starlink health vertical, Gates Frontier fund for planetary health
- Attendees could help with lunar-grade battery chemistries, radiation shielding materials, or data-sharing agreements for longitudinal physiology
- Best engagement: ask about hacking radio parts in his mother’s kitchen; invite him to improvise piano-over-radio with the event’s soundscape

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Dietary preference: pescatarian, low-sodium (family cardiac history); confirm menu with kitchen
- Sensitive: vocal about African representation in space projects—avoid tokenism; frame collaborations as co-creation
- Follow-up queries: status of ESA micro-gravity trial approvals; interest in joint patenting of haptic feedback gloves for medical exams in lunar EVA suits
