**FULL NAME:** Ada Hegerberg

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Lyon, France; maintains family retreat near Molde, Norway  
- Regular seasonal circuits: UEFA away fixtures across Europe, annual off-season camps in Los Angeles for climate-controlled altitude work

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Striker & captain, Olympique Lyonnais Féminin; all-time top scorer in UEFA Women’s Champions League  
- 2018 inaugural Ballon d’Or Féminin winner; global face of Nike’s “Equality in Sport” campaign  
- Co-founder, Hegerberg Impact Ventures—micro-fund backing female-led sports tech and injury-prevention startups

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Chasing a record-setting 10th Champions League title before her contract renewal talks in mid-2026  
- Piloting “ACL Shield,” a biomechanics wearables line developed with Oslo-based startup BioRun (series A opening Q4 2025)  
- Drafting memoir–slash–playbook “Against Gravity: High-Performance Mindset for a Level Field” for 2026 release  
- Personal aim: master conversational Spanish ahead of 2027 World Cup host selection, anticipating expanded media duties

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur astrophotographer; travels with a collapsible 90 mm refractor to night matches for post-game sky sessions  
- Favorite quote: “Records matter only if they elevate the game for the next girl.”  
- Enjoys Nordic noir fiction and espresso cupping; can identify single-origin beans blindfolded—fun ice-breaker

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- As a pioneer for women’s football, she sees the lunar dinner as symbolic “new frontier” parity moment; keen to discuss narrative framing with storytellers  
- Wants intel on low-gravity muscle-atrophy research to adapt her ACL Shield algorithms for space-health applications  
- Offers star-power draw: willing to live-stream a juggling sequence in lunar gravity for Planta’s experiential media push

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to:  
  • NASA Human Performance Lab leads (micro-gravity data)  
  • Bloomberg’s Women in Sport Investment Circle for BioRun series A  
  • Documentary producers exploring sport-and-space crossover stories  
- Attendees can help by sharing insights on remote fan-engagement tech usable during off-planet events  
- Engage her with concise, goal-oriented dialogue; segue from football metrics to broader equity themes, then pivot to space physiology—she appreciates clear through-lines

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Prefers not to dwell on her 2022 national-team pay-equity dispute; focus on forward solutions instead  
- Follow-up questions:  
  1. Status of Spanish media training—any preferred tutors the host can recommend?  
  2. Interest level in co-developing a Planta-branded athletic recovery pop-up for future lunar visits?
