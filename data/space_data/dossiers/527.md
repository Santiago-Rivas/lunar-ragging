### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Stephen Curry

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Atherton, CA; keeps condo in San Francisco for practice proximity
- Regular travel loop: Oakland-San Francisco training facilities → Los Angeles (Unanimous Media HQ) → Charlotte (family ties) → quarterly Asia trips for Under Armour & charity clinics
- Since 2024, schedules a “48-hour creative sprint” every six weeks in NYC to meet with VR studios and food-tech founders

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Point Guard & Captain, Golden State Warriors; 4× NBA Champion, 2× MVP, all-time three-point leader
- Co-founder, Unanimous Media (storytelling across film, gaming, VR, and faith-inspired content)
- Strategic investor in Under Armour’s Curry Brand, Tonal, Guild Education, AcreTrader; newest stake: Orbital Farms (closed-loop agritech)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Extending playing career through 2027 to coincide with a farewell season narrative and a possible 2028 LA Olympics three-point exhibition
- Unanimous Media green-lighting “Beyond the Arc,” an immersive docu-series on human performance in altered gravity environments (shooting segments slated for parabolic flights in 2026)
- Building Eat. Learn. Play Foundation satellites in 10 additional cities, focusing on hydroponic school gardens
- Personal: studying for a private pilot license; fascinated by orbital mechanics as a mental performance analogy

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Golf addict; prototyping a “lunar par-3” challenge framework with PGA friends
- Amateur astrophotographer—operates a remote Chilean telescope to capture deep-sky objects; keeps a printed shot of the Tranquility Base crater in his locker
- Enthusiastic board-game strategist (loves “Wingspan” and “Pandemic Legacy”) for team-bonding
- Guiding creed: “Joy unlocks repetition; repetition unlocks greatness.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence signals sports-tech crossover appeal, amplifying Planta’s mission to mass audiences
- Looking to:
  • Validate storylines for “Beyond the Arc” with real lunar-environment insights  
  • Scout food-tech collaborators for nutritious, athlete-friendly space cuisine  
  • Explore microgravity training protocols he can demo on social channels
- Offers global reach (200 M+ social followers) and a narrative skillset to showcase the dinner as a watershed cultural moment

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX Starship life-support engineers, NASA Artemis outreach leads, Michelin-star chef Dom Huang (fermentation in low-gravity), Synthesis Capital food-tech fund
- Ask him to co-host a quick-fire “low-G trick-shot” segment for Planta’s immersive broadcast
- Engage with an open-ended question on unexpected parallels between basketball shot arcs and lunar trajectories—he lights up on physics analogies

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid political angles; he is deliberately nonpartisan
- Prefers one-on-one curiosity over group fanfare—find a quiet corridor or—on the Moon—an observation deck window
- Follow-up: gauge willingness to serve as ambassador for a planned “Lunar STEM Challenge” targeting under-resourced schools via his foundation
