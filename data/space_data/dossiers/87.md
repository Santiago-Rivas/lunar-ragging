- Wants introductions to lunar horticulture team—curious about closed-loop agriculture parallels for rainforest communities
- Offers: mini-set livestreamed to Earth to spotlight Planta’s vision and Rainforest Foundation’s mission

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: ESA or NASA acoustics engineers; Artemis habitat interior designers; founders of spatial-audio XR platforms (e.g., WaveXR)
- Potential synergies with Michelin-level chefs on regenerative sourcing for Il Palagio wines & olive oil
- Engage him by: asking how underwater lyric-writing shapes his songwriting; invite him to test sing in the domed dining hall pre-dinner

### ADDITIONAL NOTES

- Surprising fact ready for the host’s prompt: he drafts melodies on a $50 USB keyboard tucked in his carry-on, claiming “constraints keep the muse honest.”
- Sensitivities: strictly plant-based diet during event; ensure low-light photography only
- Follow-up angle: explore joint charity concert beamed from the Moon—could align Planta’s brand with global reforestation fundraiser.
