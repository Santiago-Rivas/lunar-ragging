### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Martine Rothblatt

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: Miami Beach, FL & Silver Spring, MD  
- Maintains hangar access at Research Triangle Park for United Therapeutics’ organ-delivery drones  
- Regularly shuttles between Washington, D.C., Chapel Hill, and Geneva (WHO regulatory meetings)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder, Chairman & CEO, United Therapeutics (UT) – pioneering xenotransplantable and 3-D-printed organs  
- Originator of SiriusXM satellite radio; architect of the first global satellite phone licenses  
- Leading voice on transhumanism & digital consciousness; creator of BINA48 humanoid AI

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Fast-tracking FDA clearance for UT’s gene-edited pig kidneys (Phase III human trials starting Q4 2025)  
- Scaling 3-D bioprinting facilities to full “organ farm” production by 2028; exploring lunar or orbital bioreactors to leverage micro-gravity scaffolding  
- Personal quest: legal personhood framework for sentient AIs; quietly funding a Yale Law fellowship to draft model statutes  
- Recreational project: earning private astronaut wings—training with Axiom Space for a 2026 ISS mission

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Plays classical piano nightly; composes minimalist pieces inspired by orbital mechanics  
- Philosopher at heart—quotes Teilhard de Chardin’s “We are spiritual beings having a human experience”  
- Enjoys Caribbean wind-surfing and is experimenting with adaptive kites that harvest both wind & solar energy for long-haul drone flights  
- Strict plant-forward diet; fascinated by closed-loop agronomy for off-world habitats

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as proof-of-concept for permanent cis-lunar biotech labs; wants to gauge logistical hurdles for tissue culture in low-g  
- Looking to recruit partners with deep-space cold-chain or radiation-shielding expertise  
- Will captivate guests with her vision of “Unlimited organs for unlimited lives” and arguments for extending ethical frameworks beyond Earth

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: NASA Artemis Life Sciences director, SpaceX in-situ resource utilization team, Breakthrough Life Science Fund  
- Offers: access to UT’s venture arm ($300 M earmarked for space-adaptive health tech), mentorship on regulatory navigation  
- Engage her by asking, “What aspect of lunar living will most accelerate human evolution?”—she will launch into forward-looking, practical ideas

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Time-efficient: prefers tightly framed questions, zero small talk about stock price  
- Sensitive point: avoid referring to xenotransplant donors as “animals”—she uses “genetically engineered organ sources”  
- Unusual fact to prompt (per conversation goal): she built a functional replica of the 1903 Wright Flyer in her garage and flew it—few outside her family know  
- Follow-up area: her quiet initiative with UN COPUOS on “cyber-conscious” rights in extra-terrestrial jurisdictions
