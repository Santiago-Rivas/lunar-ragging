### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Chip Wilson

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Kitsilano, Vancouver, BC  
- Secondary base: Paradise Island, Bahamas; winters often spent helming family office strategy from Nassau  
- Regular quarterly swing through Los Angeles, Austin, and Tokyo to track fabric-tech startups and new retail concepts

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder, Lululemon Athletica; retains ~8% stake and informal “chief provocateur” role with design lab in Vancouver  
- Principal, Hold It All Inc. (family office): controls apparel IP, real-estate developments (e.g., East Point in Vancouver), and wellness investments  
- Philanthropy: Wilson 5 Foundation (>US $300 M committed) focused on rare-disease research, architecture education, and youth athletics

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Incubating “Gravity Adaptive Apparel” line—ultra-stretch laminates tested at parabolic-flight facilities; eyeing 2026 capsule launch  
- Leading $100 M fundraising challenge for FSHD gene-therapy trials (personally diagnosed in 2011)  
- Fast-tracking the East Point waterfront campus: mixed-use retail, design labs, and public sport courts; zoning approval expected Q1 2026  
- Personal experiment: 18-month biometric program combining cold-plunge, L-carnitine, and low-oxygen training to offset muscular degeneration

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong board-sports devotee—snowboarded 100+ days last season despite FSHD; planning prototype “low-g lunar balance board” for 2027  
- Collects mid-century Japanese industrial design; believes “form is empathy made tangible”  
- Favorite maxim: “Sweat daily, think wildly, then cut what’s average”  
- Quietly funds psychedelic-assisted therapy research; considers it a future pillar of corporate leadership development

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar setting as a live sandbox to stress-test Gravity Adaptive Apparel and community-driven retail models  
- Seeks dialogue with materials scientists, space-hab architects, and hospitality innovators on comfort & mobility in 1/6 g  
- Brings 25 years of building cult-like brand communities; can advise Planta on translating on-Earth brand rituals to off-Earth environments

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, Axiom Space hospitality team, and BMW Designworks (lunar rover interiors)  
- Attendees could assist by sharing early-stage data on micrometeoroid-resistant textiles and regenerative habitat systems  
- Best engagement tactic: prompt him with a contrarian question about when athleisure dies—he’ll counter with a moon-ready manifesto

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Steers clear of old Lululemon PR controversies; focus instead on forward-looking design philosophy  
- Prefers standing or walking conversations to stay limber; invite him to preview the habitat’s fitness corner  
- Follow-up inquiry: depth of interest in co-sponsoring a lunar wellness studio adjacent to Planta’s future installations
