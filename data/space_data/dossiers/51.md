### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Celine Dion

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: Lake Las Vegas estate (NV) and Montréal penthouse; keeps a discreet pied-à-terre near Paris’s 16ᵉ arrondissement.
- Travel pattern: Alternates two-month blocks between Vegas (studio & family hub) and Europe (fashion house meetings, medical specialists). Recent uptick in Tokyo stopovers for immersive-audio R&D with Sony.

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Global recording icon (280 M+ albums sold); five-time Grammy winner; known for record-breaking Caesars Palace residency.
- Founder, CDA Productions & Célinity IP holding company (fragrance, children’s wear, metaverse assets).
- Current executive producer for “Voix d’Étoiles,” a mixed-reality concert film slated for Spring 2027 theatrical + VR release.

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Final tracking sessions for bilingual comeback album “Gravity’s Grace” featuring AI-assisted orchestration optimized for microgravity acoustic tests.
- Managing therapy schedule for stiff-person syndrome while publicly positioning as advocate for rare-disease research funding.
- Building a boutique label to incubate francophone artists who blend classical voice with spatial-audio tech.
- Quietly assembling capital for a hospitality venture that marries haute cuisine with live vocal performance in zero-gravity simulators (target 2028 launch).

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Obsessive about aerospace history; collects Apollo-era mission patches and has a moon-dust vial gifted by a retired astronaut.
- Surprising fact she enjoys sharing: practices fluid-dynamic modeling to understand breath control—keeps MATLAB scripts on her iPad.
- Personal mantra: “Emotion is physics in resonance.”
- Downtime indulgence: builds miniature architectural models of iconic concert halls out of LEGO to study sound diffusion patterns.

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Signature voice + brand magnetism aligns with Planta’s vision of multisensory, boundary-breaking experiences; potential to deliver the first live vocal riff broadcast from the lunar surface.
- Looking to exchange ideas on how lunar architecture affects sound propagation and audience psychology.
- Seeks contacts with orbital-satellite broadcasters to trial album drop beamed from cislunar orbit—marketing hook “music that literally comes from the moon.”
- Offers star power for cross-promo campaigns, charitable auctions, or narrative content capturing human emotion in space.

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX in-flight entertainment team, Bose AR acoustics lab, UNESCO Culture in Space taskforce.
- Attendees can assist by sharing data on low-gravity culinary acoustics (crispness, carbonation) for her hospitality concept.
- Optimal engagement: invite her to a quick tour of the lunar habitat’s acoustic-testing dome; present a small, meaningful artifact (e.g., vintage recording diaphragm) to spark storytelling.

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers one-on-one conversations in serene settings; loud cocktail clusters fatigue her voice and energy.
- Diplomatic yet direct—responds well to detailed questions about craft rather than celebrity lore.
- Follow-up probes: desired charity partners for rare-disease initiative; timeline for dropping NFT tickets tied to “Voix d’Étoiles.”
