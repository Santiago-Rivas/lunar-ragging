### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Parag Agrawal

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Menlo Park, CA  
- Splits time between Bengaluru and Seattle for family and board meetings  
- Quarterly circuits through Tokyo, Berlin, and Dubai tied to sovereign tech-fund advisory roles  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & Executive Chair, Nebula Protocol Labs – building an open, censorship-resilient social graph for off-planet connectivity  
- Former CEO, Twitter; oversaw transition to real-time, algorithmic transparency APIs now industry standard  
- Strategic advisor to NASA’s Human Research Program on “behavioral comms” for long-duration missions  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing $150 M Series A for Nebula’s “Delay-Tolerant Social Stack” aimed at lunar and Martian habitats  
- Incubating a stealth company applying federated AI models to biomedical data in India & Africa  
- Personal goal: earn an FAA commercial astronaut license by Q4 2026 to validate Nebula hardware on sub-orbital flights  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobby astrophotographer; maintains a private 14-inch telescope at Dark Sky Alchemy ranch in Utah  
- Collects first-edition Urdu poetry—credits Ghalib for shaping his minimal-risk, maximal-curiosity mindset  
- Favorite maxim: “Latency reveals character—of networks and of people.”  
- Surprising tidbit: once placed 2nd nationally in India’s under-18 billiards championship; still travels with a custom cue  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as the ideal live test of Nebula’s prototype “store-and-forward social mesh” embedded in guests’ wearables  
- Wants candid feedback on psychologically meaningful notifications when round-trip latency exceeds 3 seconds  
- Able to contribute frameworks for maintaining civil discourse in isolated, high-stress environments—relevant to multi-year Mars missions  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to:  
  • ESA’s Lunar Gateway comms engineering team  
  • Chef Dominique Crenn (interested in sensory UX research for space cuisine)  
  • VC funds exploring dual-use aerospace software (e.g., Seraphim Space, Eclipse)  
- Offers: advisory bandwidth for startups tackling edge compute, federation, or trust-and-safety; can unlock Twitter alumni engineering talent pool  
- Engagement tips: open with questions about latency-induced behavior changes; bring up Urdu couplets or billiards for quick rapport  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers small group conversations away from cameras; politely avoids discussions on Twitter’s 2022 ownership drama unless framed as a systems-design lesson  
- Potential follow-up: invite him to co-author a white paper on “Lunar Social Norms” post-event  
- Flag: observing a “digital Sabbath” trend—may be offline each Sunday, plan comms accordingly
