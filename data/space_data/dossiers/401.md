### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Aanchal Malhotra

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: New Delhi, India; maintains secondary studio in Montréal, Canada (alma mater city).
- Recurrent travel loop: Delhi ↔ London ↔ Toronto every quarter for diaspora-memory workshops and book festivals.

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Writer & Oral Historian; Co-founder, Museum of Material Memory (crowdsourced digital archive of South-Asian heirlooms).
- Author of “Remnants of a Separation” & “In the Language of Remembering” – seminal texts on the lived experience of the 1947 Partition; translated into 11 languages.
- Guggenheim Fellow 2024; UNESCO consultant on intangible cultural heritage preservation in conflict zones.

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Drafting third book, “Migrations of Taste,” tracing recipes that survived displacement across three generations; fieldwork wraps Q4 2025.
- Piloting an AR tool that overlays oral testimonies onto everyday objects, partnering with MIT Media Lab’s Civic Design group.
- Building an endowment to transition Museum of Material Memory from volunteer-run to a permanent institution with on-ground labs in Delhi and Lahore.
- Personal aim: improve proficiency in conversational Farsi to access refugee narratives in Iran by 2026.

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects antique ink bottles and restores early-20th-century fountain pens—claims the smell of aged ink “holds more stories than paper.”
- Trained printmaker; still pulls limited-edition etchings at odd hours to “reset narrative fatigue.”
- Guiding philosophy: “Objects remember what people forget; our duty is to listen.”
- Relaxes with high-altitude trekking; credits the Himalayas for her stamina during marathon interview sessions.

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to contextualize how lunar artifacts (first dinner plates, cutlery, garments) can be curated as living memory for future settlements.
- Seeking technologists who can embed memory layers into materials—smart ceramics, reactive fabrics—to carry stories in low-gravity environments.
- Offers thought-leadership on designing human rituals that foster belonging in off-world colonies, blending anthropology with sensory storytelling.

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Dr. Mei-Ling Chen (NASA Heritage Preservation Lead)  
  • Halcyon Ventures’ XR fund for the AR testimony project  
  • Chef-astronaut teams exploring cultural cuisine on long-duration missions.
- Attendees can assist by sharing archival access to early space-age personal objects or micro-gravity-safe ink formulations.
- Engage her with open-ended questions about the single object she would carry to the Moon—she has a rehearsed but intriguing answer involving a hexagonal silver inkpot.

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers quiet seating zones—suffers mild sensory overload in high-decibel spaces; noise-canceling headband helps.
- Avoid framing Partition work as “historic trauma tourism”; emphasize resilience and continuity themes.
- Follow-up Qs: status of AR tool beta release; whether Museum of Material Memory would archive physical lunar dinner artifacts after mission.
