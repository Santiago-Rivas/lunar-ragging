### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Emily Pilloton-Lam

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Berkeley, CA (Girls Garage HQ)
- Satellite presence in Houston (monthly NASA outreach) and Raleigh-Durham (family + rural build projects)
- Pattern: 1-week “build sprints” every quarter in under-resourced communities, followed by intense writing retreats in Big Sur

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Executive Director, Girls Garage—nation’s first all-girls design/build workshop (over 4,000 alumnae, 180+ public structures)
- Author of “Girls Garage” and “Tell Them I Built This”; new book on radical shop pedagogy under HarperCollins
- TED main-stage speaker; Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Award; consults on K-12 maker-space strategy for NASA Office of STEM Engagement

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Raising a $10 M growth fund to replicate Girls Garage in 5 additional U.S. cities by 2027
- Prototyping low-gravity construction curriculum in partnership with Intuitive Machines—goal: first youth-designed greenhouse module on a 2028 lunar lander
- Building a digital library of 1,000 open-source shop projects translated into Spanish, Mandarin, and ASL
- Personal: training for her first ultramarathon; restoring a 1968 Honda CB350 motorcycle for cross-country STEAM pop-up events

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Night-owl welder; claims “a perfect MIG bead is better than meditation”
- Collects retired aerospace materials to upcycle into classroom furniture
- Guiding maxim: “Design without community is just decoration.”
- Surprising hook: holds a private pilot’s license; flies Craigslist-rescued Cessnas to deliver tools to rural build sites

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to share perspective on inclusive, community-driven habitat design for off-earth living
- Looking to connect with space-forward philanthropists and XR platform founders to co-develop an immersive “Lunar Girls Garage” experience
- Can contribute a hands-on micro-workshop—guests laser-cut personal lunar keepsakes from recycled launch-pad aluminum

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Artemis STEM Outreach Lead, Blue Origin Club for the Future grants team, Patagonia’s corporate impact fund
- Attendees can help by offering VR/AR expertise, surplus aerospace scrap, or commitments to host pop-up build days in their hometowns
- Engage her with concrete challenges (e.g., “How would you build a greenhouse wall from regolith?”); she thrives on rapid ideation over dinner

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Allergic to shellfish—confirm menu accommodations before lunar departure
- Prefers straight talk; minimal slides, maximal sketches on napkins
- Post-event follow-up: send CAD files of the lunar base layout so she can create youth-friendly construction guides
- Potential deep-dive question: “What safety compromises are you unwilling to make for the sake of spectacle?”
