### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Susan Wojcicki

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Altos, CA | secondary residence in Truckee for family ski weekends  
- Regular circuits: Mountain View (Alphabet advisory meetings), Boston/Cambridge (Harvard Board of Overseers), Warsaw twice yearly for Polish tech-policy forums

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Former CEO, YouTube (2014-2023); now Senior Advisor to Alphabet with remit on creator economy & emerging platforms  
- Founder, Andromeda Ventures – family office deploying $250 M into edtech, digital health, and space-enabled communications  
- Key achievements: grew YouTube to 2.6 B monthly users, launched YouTube Kids & Shorts, championed revenue-share model that paid creators $70 B+

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Building “Next-Gen Classroom” initiative: immersive, low-bandwidth learning modules adaptable to remote or off-world habitats  
- Seed investment in LunarLink, a startup prototyping optical relay nodes for cislunar live-streaming  
- Co-authoring memoir “Upload: Lessons in Scaling Human Expression” (target release Q4 2026)  
- Personal goal: learn conversational Polish well enough to host a Warsaw TED-style salon in 2027

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects vintage NASA mission patches; sketches watercolor moonscapes during long flights  
- Weekly family “innovation dinners” where each child presents a moonshot idea—tradition started in 2020 lockdown  
- Guiding view: “Platforms aren’t neutral—design equals values.”  
- Enjoys trail-running and quietly competes in Bay Area half-marathons under an alias; uses runs to test wearable language-learning earbuds

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Curious how micro-gravity alters social cues and communal storytelling—data useful for upcoming LunarLink pilot  
- Hopes to meet immersive chefs to discuss multi-sensory content layers for edtech (taste + lesson)  
- Can contribute expertise on scaling global communities, monetization strategies for off-world experiences, and early capital for infrastructure bridging Earth-Moon latency gaps

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX Starlink Lunar Coverage team; European Space Agency XR outreach lead; Global EdTech Fund partners  
- Asks: demos of holographic social platforms that function sub-100 kbps; research on circadian lighting for learning in lunar habitats  
- Best engagement: invite her to brainstorm “first lesson ever streamed from the Moon” over dessert; present concise data then pivot to creative possibilities

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: fatigued by questions on YouTube moderation controversies—prefers forward-focused dialogue  
- Values brevity: 90-second pitches, clear asks  
- Follow-up curiosities: her hidden half-marathon alias, favorite mission patch (hint: Apollo-Soyuz ‘75)  
- Possible depth probe: viability timeline for optical vs. RF lunar comms—she’s seeking co-investors to close LunarLink’s Series A
