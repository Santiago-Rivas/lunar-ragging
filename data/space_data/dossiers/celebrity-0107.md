### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Rami Malek

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Feliz, Los Angeles  
- Maintains pied-à-terre in London’s Soho (used for West End rehearsals & filming)  
- Predictable travel cycle: LA ↔ NY for press, periodic Cairo visits to stay close to extended family, growing interest in Tokyo stopovers to study minimal-tech stagecraft  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Academy Award–winning actor & producer (Bohemian Rhapsody, Mr. Robot, Oppenheimer)  
- Co-founder, Little Pharaoh Pictures – boutique label funding culturally diverse thrillers and prestige limited series  
- Voice & performance-capture lead for “Luna Noir,” an upcoming Apple Vision-Pro interactive narrative slated for late 2026  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Securing final financing for directorial debut: a near-future drama exploring isolation on a Lagrange-point station  
- Negotiating with Universal Music for rights to produce a Freddie Mercury immersive concert experience in mixed reality  
- Personal stretch goal: complete private pilot certification by mid-2026, eyeing suborbital qualification afterward  
- Philanthropic push: expanding his scholarships for first-gen STEM/arts students at University of Evansville and Cairo’s AUC  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Obsessed with vintage analog synths; restores Roland Jupiter-8s in his garage as a form of meditation  
- Keeps a handwritten dream journal; says many of his character backstories originate there  
- Guiding maxim: “Vulnerability is the most unhackable software.”  
- Surprising fact he enjoys revealing: took a six-month mime apprenticeship in Paris before Mr. Robot to master micro-expressions  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as research for both “Luna Noir” and his space-station film—seeks authentic sensory data on low-gravity social dynamics  
- Wants candid conversations about how isolation alters perception of time, taste, and trust  
- Offers star power for Planta’s narrative content (voiceover, promo vignette), plus producer connections to convert the lunar dinner into a documentary short  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX production liaison team; Michelin-level chefs experimenting with texture modulation in micro-g; investors in haptics (e.g., HaptX) for “Luna Noir”  
- Attendees can help by sharing personal routines that maintain mental equilibrium in extreme environments  
- Engage him through small, curiosity-driven challenges—e.g., co-designing a 30-second zero-gravity theatrical gesture  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers one-on-one dialogue over group panels; slight crowd anxiety masked by professionalism  
- Politely avoids alcohol; enjoys rare herbal teas—suggest offering a curated lunar tisane tasting  
- Follow-up areas: confirm his timeline for pilot certification (possible tie-in flight with event partner), and explore whether Planta’s social-connectivity tech could feature in his Freddie Mercury XR project
