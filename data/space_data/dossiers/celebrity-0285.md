### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Sundar Pichai

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Altos Hills, CA; secondary apartment in New York’s Flatiron district for policy & investor meetings
- Regular rotation: Brussels, Bangalore, and Singapore every quarter to manage regulatory, talent, and APAC growth agendas
- Known for “48-hour hops”—compressed global trips that minimize time away from family and cricket-club coaching commitments

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chief Executive Officer, Alphabet & Google (since 2019); oversees >190 K employees, $320 B revenue run-rate
- Architect of Gemini AI platform, Google’s largest generative AI deployment across Search, Cloud, and Android
- Spearheaded “Planetary Compute” initiative—low-latency edge infrastructure for orbital, lunar, and Martian missions in partnership with NASA & ESA

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Driving Alphabet’s 2025–2028 OKRs: universal multimodal search, sovereign AI compliance tooling, and quantum-secure cloud
- Personally shepherding “Project Helix,” a lightweight, radiation-hardened TPU array designed for off-Earth data centers (lunar base pilot slated for 2027)
- Mentoring next-gen Indian deep-tech founders via a $1 B Alphabet fund; wants at least three moonshot climate ventures in portfolio by 2026
- Family focus: preparing daughter’s move to Stanford; seeking balanced schedule that allows one week per quarter completely offline

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong cricket tactician; organizes impromptu “gully cricket” matches with Googlers—keeps a foldable bat in carry-on
- Collects antique slide rules; believes “analog precision informs digital intuition”
- Guiding maxim: “Technology’s role is to give everyone a superpower, not steal one.” Values understated, data-backed debate over showmanship
- Enjoys spicy South Indian comfort food; will trade recipes for insider tips on lunar hydroponic herbs

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Alphabet is providing edge compute, vision mapping, and language translation APIs for Planta’s lunar social platform
- Looking to validate Project Helix under true lunar conditions; wants feedback from early adopters on latency-sensitive social interactions
- Seeks candid dialogue on maintaining human warmth in ultra-mediated environments—hoping to hear novel perspectives beyond Silicon Valley echo chambers
- Contribution: can offer real-time translation layer enabling multilingual dinner conversation and a VR recap stream for Earth-bound classrooms

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • NASA Artemis operations team (for data relay integration)  
  • Chef David Chang (to co-design culturally inclusive lunar menu)  
  • UN Office for Outer Space Affairs delegate (space sustainability standards)
- Ways attendees can help: share edge-case user stories for lunar/remote social networking; propose moon-based citizen-science collaborations
- Engaging him: open with a probing question on personal routines that keep him grounded during zero-lag global travel; segue into cricket or vintage calculation tools to build rapport

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: keeps public statements cautiously apolitical—avoid dragging into partisan tech-regulation debates unless invited
- Surprising fact prompt: he once won an intra-Google chili-cook-off with a traditional Chettinad recipe; few outside know of his competitive cooking streak
- Follow-up: gauge interest in a post-event “Moon-to-Mumbai” educational livestream connecting rural Indian students with lunar crew
