### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Mo Ibrahim

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: London (Chelsea townhouse & Foundation HQ in Marylebone)  
- Secondary footholds: Dubai for capital markets access; Kigali for pan-African governance forums  
- Travels on a 6-week rhythm across Nairobi, Accra, and Washington, D.C. to monitor digital-infrastructure grants and meet policymakers  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder, Celtel International (sold 2005 for $3.4 B); architect of the “one-network, no-roaming” model across 14 African nations  
- Chair, Mo Ibrahim Foundation – issuer of the Ibrahim Prize and annual African Governance Index, now integrated into several multilateral risk dashboards  
- Limited Partner & senior adviser, SatBridge Capital, a $750 M fund targeting low-orbit connectivity, climate-data constellations, and edge-cloud services for the Global South  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Championing a pan-African digital ID & payments backbone (“AfriStream”) to unlock intra-continental e-commerce by 2028  
- Structuring a $250 M blended-finance vehicle for climate-resilient telecom towers (solar + battery micro-grids) in Sahel and Horn regions  
- Personal passion project: curating a travelling photography exhibit—“Cities After Sundown”—spotlighting African urban nightlife to shift global narratives  
- Quietly assembling an interdisciplinary advisory board on “Ethics of Extraterrestrial Connectivity” to influence early lunar governance charters  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur oud player; believes the instrument “teaches patience more effectively than any board meeting”  
- Collects rare cartographic maps illustrating colonial telegraph routes—drives his conviction that the next century’s power lines are invisible data links  
- Core philosophy: “Good governance is cheaper than bad governance—just look at the balance sheet.”  
- Surprising fact: spent his first university scholarship funds on a motorbike tour from Khartoum to Alexandria; still rides incognito on Sunday dawn runs along the Thames Embankment  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Pioneer in connecting underserved geographies—natural ally for demonstrating the social value of lunar-based connectivity and storytelling  
- Seeking dialogue on latency challenges for Earth-Moon communications and pathways for emerging-market talent to contribute to cislunar infrastructure  
- Can offer historical parallels on how early terrestrial networks shaped social contracts—valuable framing for Planta’s narrative workshops  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros requested to:  
  • NASA’s Lunar Communications Relay task force  
  • SpaceX Starshield policy unit (for sovereign bandwidth discussions)  
  • Chef-astronaut José Andrés re: “food as diplomacy” programming on-orbit  
- Attendees can assist by sharing use-cases where immersive VR/AR strengthened diaspora ties—data points for AfriStream pilot designs  
- Engagement tip: open with cartography or music, then bridge to governance; he lights up when discussing “systems that outlive founders”  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid over-praising philanthropist label; prefers “infrastructure engineer.”  
- Sensitive topic: Sudan’s ongoing political turbulence—approach from solutions, not sympathy.  
- Follow-up questions: progress of blended-finance tower vehicle, and timeline for ethics advisory board publication.
