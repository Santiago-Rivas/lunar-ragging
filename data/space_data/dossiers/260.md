### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Taylor Fritz

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Rancho Palos Verdes, CA
- Maintains training flats in Monte-Carlo (clay season) and Dubai (off-season heat training)
- Clocked 250+ travel days/year; accustomed to rapid circadian adaptation—useful for lunar gravity & time-shift demo

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Top-10 ATP tennis player; youngest American to reach that tier since Andy Roddick
- Co-founder, GripIQ Analytics – sensor-based racket insert tracking spin & stroke biomechanics (seed round closed Feb 2025)
- Endorsement portfolio shifting from classic apparel to tech-forward brands (Rolex → Oura Ring advisory role)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Targeting Grand Slam title by 2026; integrating AI-driven match simulation and sleep-altitude protocols
- Scaling GripIQ into multi-sport platform; in talks with NBA G-League for pilot
- Personally exploring longevity and bone-density research—concerned about athlete skeletal health post-career
- Building content studio for creator-athlete collaborations (short-form lessons, VR practice courts) to launch Q3 2025

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur astrophotographer; travels with a collapsible 80 mm refractor—claims star-fields calm pre-match nerves
- Collects vintage mechanical keyboards; fascinated by tactile feedback parallels with racket strings
- Reads speculative sci-fi (favorite: “The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet”) for mental reset
- Guiding philosophy: “Consistency beats brilliance—if brilliance isn’t ready on demand”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence underscores sport-human-performance narrative in extraterrestrial environments
- Curious about muscle atrophy countermeasures in micro-gravity; wants to meet researchers behind Planta’s kinetic lounges
- Hoping to glean storytelling angles for GripIQ’s “play anywhere” marketing—lunar court concept footage
- Offers global reach (3.5 M social followers) to amplify event’s experiential footage to mainstream sports fans

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intro requested to: 
  • Dr. Aisha Raman (NASA musculoskeletal lead)  
  • Pluto Capital’s sports-tech micro-fund (rumored attending)  
- Could demo a live serve in reduced gravity—grab press headlines and provide data for Planta’s motion-capture suite
- Engage him with rapid-fire questions about translating elite focus to novel environments; invite him to test VR social modules while discussing latency effects on reaction time

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Dislikes protracted small talk; opens up over concrete metrics or gadget demos
- Surprising fact prompt angle: he built his own custom streaming PC & codes basic Python scripts to analyze Hawk-Eye data
- Follow-up: ask whether GripIQ’s next funding round allocates budget for space-adapted hardware—seed pre-commitment possible if synergy emerges
