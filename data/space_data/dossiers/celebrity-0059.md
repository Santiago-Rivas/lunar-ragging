### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Bono

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Dalkey, Dublin — ocean-view residence doubling as writing studio
- Secondary foothold: Central Manhattan apartment near UN HQ; quick hops to Los Angeles for recording sessions
- Typical pattern: 10-day “impact sprints” (Capitol Hill, Brussels, Nairobi) stitched between tour rehearsals; avoids long stretches offline but increasingly schedules “deep-work retreats” in remote locales

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Frontman & lyricist, U2; overseeing 16th studio album blending spatial audio & AI-generated visual stagecraft
- Co-founder, ONE Campaign & (RED); architect of $45 B in global health financing
- Founding partner, Elevation Partners → new spin-out “Elevation Earth” targeting climate-tech and immersive-media startups

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Negotiating 2026 “Orbitals” residency: multi-city arena shows with an XR-layer that audiences can stream in VR headsets
- Quietly assembling a coalition for a Debt-for-Climate swap program ahead of COP32
- Personal mission: ensure artists retain IP in the age of generative AI; drafting an “Artist Rights Charter” with WIPO allies
- Health focus: maintaining ocular health (long-term glaucoma) and bone-density training for anticipated sub-gravity travel

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong sketchbook addict; trades charcoal portraits with crew members to gauge tour morale
- Collects vintage space-race postage stamps—claims it keeps him “humble before impossible ideas”
- Guiding maxim: “The world is more malleable than you think—press it and see.”
- Unusual fact he enjoys sharing: once co-wrote an unreleased lullaby album for premature infants in neonatal wards

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Intrigued by the symbolic leap from stadium to satellite—sees the lunar dinner as “the highest acoustic ceiling ever”
- Wants to explore how Planta’s ambient-reality tech could power an interplanetary charity concert simulcast
- Seeking conversation on psychological wellbeing of long-duration space crews; believes music therapy can be standardized
- Offers: iconic storytelling, global press magnetism, and a Rolodex of policy makers who unlock regulatory pathways for commercial space-flight and climate finance

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: SpaceX Starlink philanthropy team, ESA psychosocial research leads, and NetZero Capital’s lunar-regolith concrete startup
- Attendees can aid by sharing lunar logistics data useful for a 20-minute micro-set broadcast Bono is sketching
- Engage him by asking which song he’d first play on the moon—he will segue into rights, acoustics, and human unity

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers small circles over banquet spectacles; position him at a 6-person table, ideally with one young African climate innovator
- Security: discreet but tight; confirm visor-friendly lighting to protect sensitive eyes
- Follow-up items: gauge his interest in a co-authored “Moon Manifesto” op-ed with Planta, and confirm if Elevation Earth can preview their Space-for-Earth investment thesis to select guests
