### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Haile Gebrselassie

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (Bole district office & training track)
- Regular monthly loops: Dubai ↔ Frankfurt (hospitality investors) and Nairobi (East-African athletics circuit)
- Keeps a “72-hour bag” ready for surprise keynote or charity runs—values spontaneity

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Executive Chairman, Haile Hotels & Resorts (8 properties, 2,300 rooms across Ethiopia & Djibouti)
- Founder, Haile Farms & Coffee (single-origin Sidama beans sold in 28 countries)
- Two-time Olympic gold medalist; 27 world records—global symbol of endurance and possibility

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a $60 M green-bond package to solar-power all resort operations by Q4 2026
- Building the “1-K High-Altitude Performance Campus” outside Addis—first elite center combining VO₂ max labs, permaculture fields, and athlete-led social enterprise incubator
- Personal ambition: place Ethiopian teff on UNESCO’s Intangible Heritage list and double export volume within 18 months
- Quiet R&D stake in micro-sat imagery startup mapping Horn of Africa crop stress; sees space tech as next competitive edge for African agribusiness

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Unwinds by restoring antique mechanical watches—claims the rhythmic ticking mirrors a perfect 180 spm running cadence
- Loves Miles Davis’s “Sketches of Spain” for pre-race visualization; jazz and long-distance share “disciplined improvisation”
- Guiding maxim: “If you want to go fast, set the pace; if you want to go far, set the standard”
- Fascinated by low-gravity biomechanics—has calculated he could clear a 6-meter stride on the Moon

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited as living proof of human limits redefined—parallels between world-record runs and pioneering off-Earth social experiences
- Seeks dialogue on: lunar agriculture prototypes (hydroponic teff), physiological studies of endurance in 1/6 g, and hospitality design for extreme environments
- Brings storytelling power: can open dinner with a 90-second visualization exercise used before his Sidney 2000 10K gold—sets a tone of collective ambition

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: SpaceX food systems R&D lead; Patagonia Ventures’ regenerative agriculture fund; ESA human-performance scientists
- Happy to mentor young African founders attending via holo-presence—will sponsor one to his altitude campus
- Engage him by asking for his “next race”—he’ll reveal the surprise: planning a 42.195 km treadmill marathon aboard an orbital station in 2028

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers non-alcoholic tej-inspired honey spritzers; strict 4:30 AM wake cycle—schedule any follow-up before 9 PM lunar time
- Delight question aligning with host goal: “Beyond running and business, what’s an unexpected craft you’re perfecting?” (Expect watchmaking story)
- Areas to probe later: partnership structure for the crop-imagery startup; political sensitivities around Ethiopian Athletics Federation reforms
