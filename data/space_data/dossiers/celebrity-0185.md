### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Trent Alexander-Arnold

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Liverpool city centre penthouse overlooking the Mersey
- Regular London stays (brand meetings, charity board sessions); quarterly hops to New York & Los Angeles for sponsorship shoots
- Matches drive a tight Sat–Wed travel rhythm across Europe; off-season trips lean toward tech hubs (San Francisco, Tokyo) rather than classic holiday islands

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Vice-Captain & starting right-back, Liverpool FC; 300+ senior appearances, 2× PFA Team of the Year
- Founder, TAA Academy – data-driven youth programme pairing football coaching with STEM tutoring
- Early-stage investor in ReacTX (real-time athlete biometrics) & Moonshot eSports Collective

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- On-pitch: spearheading Liverpool’s inverted-full-back tactical system; eyeing the 2026 North American World Cup as England’s centerpiece playmaker
- Off-pitch: building a “beyond-90-minutes” media platform that blends sports analytics, interactive streaming, and fan-direct NFTs
- Personal study: completing executive online module in Space Systems Engineering (MIT xPRO) to understand orbital manufacturing prospects for future sports gear
- 12-month ambition: formal partnership with a carbon-negative materials startup to develop sustainable football boots

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong chess player; travels with a pocket set and logs ELO-style ratings against teammates
- Keeps a signed Apollo 11 mission patch framed beside his first Champions League medal
- Philosophy: “Precision over power—whether it’s a cross or a conversation”
- Enjoys composing lo-fi beats; shares private SoundCloud links only with close friends

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- High-profile athlete lends “human performance” angle to lunar social experiments; curious how low-gravity affects proprioception and ball dynamics
- Seeks dialogue on VR/AR fan engagement in extreme environments; wants to test live-streamed skill-challenges from orbit
- Potential contribution: galvanizing global youth attention, driving media buzz, and offering data from his wearable-tech partners for real-time biodashboards during the dinner

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired:
  • SpaceX or Axiom Space human-factors researchers  
  • Michelin-level chefs exploring performance nutrition in micro-gravity  
  • Creative leads at Epic Games to discuss a lunar football mini-game
- Host can offer behind-the-scenes lunar base tour focusing on training rigs; pair him with an astronaut who played elite sport in college for instant rapport
- Engage him by asking for the most unconventional surface he’s practiced free-kicks on—sets up the “lunar crossbar challenge” idea

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers data-rich, solution-oriented talk; tunes out generic celebrity flattery
- Avoid revisiting 2021 social-media backlash around England penalty tactics—still a sore spot
- Follow-up Q: gauge appetite for co-producing a short doc on “First Touch on the Moon,” blending sport, science, and social impact
