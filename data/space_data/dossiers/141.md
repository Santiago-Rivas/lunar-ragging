### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Pre-production on “Silent Orbit,” a Mandarin-English lunar thriller slated to shoot partially in orbit via Axiom Station 2 in 2028
- Building a $75 M cross-border film-tech fund backing volumetric capture, haptic storytelling, and real-time translation tools
- Personal: refining her Mandarin calligraphy line to launch a limited NFT/physical art drop benefiting earthquake-resilient schools in Sichuan by Q4 2025

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Early-morning ballet routine learned at Beijing Dance Academy—still practices pointe work for core strength in microgravity training
- Amateur radio license (call sign: BG1ZZY); hopes to transmit a short Mandarin poem from the lunar surface
- Collects first-edition sci-fi novels; favorite quote: “Reality is the canvas, imagination the brush—gravity just the frame”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevant as a cultural bridge and potential on-site storyteller; evaluating Planta’s tech stack for immersive BTS content for “Silent Orbit”
- Seeks: XR engineers who can down-link high-fidelity volumetric footage under lunar bandwidth limits; chefs willing to iterate on Sichuan-meets-space cuisine concepts
- Brings: Global media amplification (96 M combined followers), seasoned on-camera presence, and nuanced perspective on East-West collaboration

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Artemis communications team, Epic Games’ Unreal Engine VP of virtual production, Temasek’s Innovation Fund for impact media
- Attendees can help by offering micro-gravity choreography insights, lunar acoustics data for sound design, and philanthropic co-sponsorship for Sichuan schools
- Engaging approach: Ask about her lunar radio poem idea or share sensory-deprivation experiences; she lights up when conversations blend art, tech, and childlike wonder
