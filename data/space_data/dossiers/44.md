### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Andrea Bocelli

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Forte dei Marmi, Tuscany; secondary home in North Miami Beach
- Tours 9–10 months annually; keeps a “five weeks on, two weeks off” cycle to protect vocal health
- Regular winter retreats in the Alps for silence and altitude training

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- World-renowned tenor; 100 M+ albums sold across classical–pop crossover
- Founder, Andrea Bocelli Foundation (ABF) – €50 M deployed to date for music education & disaster relief
- Pioneer of large-scale mixed-reality concerts (Apple Vision Pro “Believe XR” experience, 2024)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Recording “Celestials,” a 2026 album of sacred arias engineered for 3D spatial audio
- Negotiating a zero-gravity concert broadcast from a commercial space-plane (target 2028)
- Expanding ABF’s “Voices of the World” program to refugee camps in Lebanon and Kenya
- Personal goal: master braille music notation well enough to self-orchestrate without assistants

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate equestrian; says the rhythmic gait of a horse “teaches phrasing better than a metronome”
- Collects vintage Italian fountain pens; always carries one loaded with sepia ink
- Favorite maxim: “The eyes may close, but vision must widen.”
- Surprising fact: composes fragrance accords as a hobby—has a small lab for testing Tuscan herb notes
- Deeply curious about how altered gravity affects diaphragmatic support and resonance

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn by the chance to test vocal performance in lunar acoustics and low gravity
- Seeking acoustic engineers to model reverberation inside Planta’s habitat; open to a live micro-performance if safety standards allow
- Hoping to discuss inclusive design for sensory-impaired travelers in future space tourism
- Can offer a signature aria to open the dinner, creating a historic cultural moment for Planta’s brand narrative

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intro desired to SpaceX’s acoustics or life-support teams for the 2028 zero-G concert concept
- Potential partnership with Michelin-starred chefs on site to develop a multisensory “taste-sound” pairing for charity galas
- Attendees with XR or haptic tech can pitch collaborative tools for blind musicians; Bocelli is an active beta-tester
- Best engagement: invite him to touch and “hear” lunar materials—he processes spaces through texture and echo

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers low lighting and clear, uncluttered floor plans; tactile guidance mats appreciated
- Enjoys philosophical conversation far more than small talk; references Dante and St. Augustine easily
- Follow-up question: Which braille-enabled wearable is he currently evaluating for on-site navigation?
