**FULL NAME:** Angelina Jolie

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Feliz, Los Angeles  
- Secondary hubs: New York City (atelier HQ) & Siem Reap, Cambodia (family foundation)  
- Predictable travel cycle: quarterly trips to Geneva & Nairobi for refugee policy sessions; summers split between Paris film sets and Cambodian conservation sites  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Filmmaker, actor, and humanitarian strategist; Founder, Atelier Jolie (ethical fashion & artistry collective)  
- Special Envoy emerita, UNHCR; architect of the 2024 Global Child Protector Fund (now at $650 M)  
- Academy Award winner; directing slate includes the 2026 epic “Cleopatra” and Disney’s untitled sci-fi adventure in pre-production  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling Atelier Jolie’s regenerative textile lab in up-cycled space-grade materials—NASA subcontract under discussion  
- Finalizing a docu-series with Netflix on displaced youth and emerging space-colonization ethics  
- Personal focus: preparing eldest son Maddox for graduate studies in astrophysics; mother-son joint research on sustainable lunar agriculture  
- Six-month health sprint: post-production pilates + zero-gravity conditioning to certify for suborbital flight ahead of 2027 lunar journey  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong knife collector; designs ceremonial blades inspired by Khmer heritage  
- Licensed pilot; flies her own Cirrus SR22 when schedules allow—believes “altitude invites perspective”  
- Practices api-therapy; ambassador for UNESCO’s “Women for Bees” program—envisions micro-hives in space habitats  
- Relaxes by sketching abandoned architecture; keeps a travel Moleskine filled with lunar-base layouts  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Moon dinner as a living lab for refugee-camp innovation; assessing closed-loop housing systems adaptable to crisis zones  
- Looking to swap ideas on sensory-rich meals in low gravity—keen to test insect-protein pâtés grown via Planta fermenters  
- Seeks collaborators with XR storytelling tools to immerse policymakers in off-world humanitarian scenarios  
- Brings star power, policy fluency, and a 60 M-strong social platform to amplify event insights  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX Life-Support R&D team; World Central Kitchen leadership; MIT Media Lab’s Responsive Environments group  
- Attendees can help by offering design feedback on lunar-suitable fabrics and directing her to small-batch material scientists  
- Engage her with tactile prototypes or personal narratives; she responds best to concrete human impact stories over pure tech demos  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid dredging up past marital headlines; focus on forward-looking family and humanitarian themes  
- Subtle health cue: watches sodium intake due to hereditary hypertension—flag any heavily salted menu items  
- Follow-up Q for deeper rapport: “What surprised you most while training for zero-gravity flight, and how did it change your view of earthbound humanitarian work?”  
- Conversation-goal hook: invite her to reveal her lesser-known passion for medieval astronomy manuscripts—she collects them quietly and lights up when asked.
