### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Stevie Nicks

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles; maintains retreat ranch north of Phoenix for songwriting sabbaticals
- Tours in 6–8-week bursts, then retreats for vocal rest; accepts only 2–3 long-haul international dates per year

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Singer-songwriter, co-lead vocalist of Fleetwood Mac; two-time Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee (band 1998, solo 2019)
- 140 M+ records sold worldwide; streaming renaissance since viral 2020 “Dreams” TikTok moment
- Executive Producer, upcoming Apple TV+ limited series “Rhiannon”—a semi-biographical fantasy anchored by her catalog

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing 50th-anniversary “Rumours Reimagined” Dolby Atmos mix for 2026 release
- Building “Songs in the Shadows” foundation to mentor women 18–30 in songwriting, sobriety, and industry resilience
- Health management: daily Peloton + Pilates, strict vocal-rest protocols; aiming for “moon-ready” medical clearance by mid-2026
- Personal ambition: leave a canonical digital archive of handwritten lyrics, journals, and stage-wear in mixed-reality format before 2030

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong fascination with mythology, lunar symbolism, and astral aesthetics—keeps a telescope on her balcony and tracks NASA mission feeds
- Collects Victorian poetry and vintage Polaroids; curates a rotating “dream board” in her studio
- Guiding mantra: “If you can’t find the light, be the candle.”
- Surprising fact: practices lucid-dream journaling every morning; credits it for melodic breakthroughs

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- “Moon Dinner” aligns perfectly with her decades-long lunar imagery (e.g., “Sisters of the Moon”); eager to perform an acoustic vignette in reduced gravity if logistics allow
- Interested in discussing immersive fan experiences—AR concert bubbles, haptic album jackets, lunar-broadcast premieres
- Seeking insight on low-gravity vocal acoustics and how in-helmet audio could shape future performances
- Brings cultural gravitas and cross-generational fanbase; media attention multiplies event visibility

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: SpaceX acoustic engineers, Dolby Labs spatial-audio R&D, and high-end couture designers exploring smart textiles for micro-gravity
- Offers mentorship or collaboration to young artist-technologists blending music, XR, and narrative
- Engage her with one provocative question about the intersection of dreams and off-planet creativity—she’ll open up quickly when conversation feels poetic rather than technical

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive topic: maintains strict sobriety since 1994—ensure bar staff aware of non-alcoholic champagne substitute
- Prefers dim lighting and low ambient noise to protect eyesight and hearing
- Follow-up Q for future planning: gauge interest in recording a live “Landslide (Sea of Tranquility Version)” for charitable release benefiting lunar research scholarships
