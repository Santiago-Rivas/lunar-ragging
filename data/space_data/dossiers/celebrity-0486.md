### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Limor Fried

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: SoHo, Manhattan; Adafruit HQ & factory two subway stops from her loft lab  
- Predictable travel loops: quarterly Shenzhen component runs, bi-monthly Orlando warehouse checks, annual pilgrimage to Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin  
- Recent uptick in meetings at Houston’s Johnson Space Center—early tests of “CircuitPython-in-Space” initiative  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Chief Engineer, Adafruit Industries (300+ open-source hardware SKUs, >$60 M annual revenue)  
- Host, “Desk of Ladyada” & “The Great Search” livestreams (200 k average viewers/week)  
- IEEE “Entrepreneur of the Year,” White House Open Maker honoree, board member of OSHWA & NYC Center for Climate Technology  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling Adafruit’s new PicoSat Sensor Pack: credit-card board that transmits environmental data from orbit for <$200 unit  
- Building a low-power, open-source life-support telemetry suite for private space habitats (in talks with Axiom & Vast)  
- Lobbying for U.S. Right-to-Repair extensions to cover aerospace electronics  
- Personal six-month OKR: finish her own “Lady Moog” modular synth and press an experimental vinyl EP  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Keeps a private arcade cabinet graveyard; restores vector displays while streaming synthwave playlists  
- FCC-licensed amateur radio operator (call sign AC2SN); bounces packets off the moon “just for latency kicks”  
- Guiding maxim: “If you can’t open it, you don’t own it—applies on Earth, Mars, or Luna.”  
- Favorite dinner-table icebreaker: swap stories about accidental electrostatic discharges that ruined a prototype  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar dinner aligns with her goal to prove hobbyist-grade electronics can survive low-gravity dinner parties & beyond  
- Seeking dialogue on regolith-based 3-D printing enclosures to shield sensitive boards from radiation  
- Brings value: can rapidly prototype wearable sensor swag so each guest leaves with live biometric data captured on the moon  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired:  
  • Materials expert familiar with sintered regolith coatings  
  • VC funds tolerant of medium-margin hardware (e.g., Eclipse Ventures)  
  • Mission planners at JSC evaluating “maker-style” payloads for Artemis support flights  
- Offer to host a post-event livestream featuring fellow attendees’ lunar insights, reaching 1 M+ maker subscribers  
- Best engagement: hand her an unpolished prototype and ask “How would you hack this for the moon?”—she’ll talk for hours  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Usually avoids alcohol; sparkling water + a bag of resistors keeps her happy  
- Slightly noise-sensitive—prefers side-table chats over main-stage fanfare  
- Follow-up question worth posing: “What’s the most unconventional analog input you’re planning for your lunar sensor pack?”
