### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Mukesh Ambani

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Antilia residence, Mumbai
- Secondary homes: Stokes Park Estate (UK) & Manhattan pied-à-terre; maintains a Gulfstream G650 and newly ordered Dassault Falcon 10X for trans-Atlantic hops
- Quarterly circuits: Mumbai → London → Silicon Valley → Dubai, timed around investment committee meetings and family schedules

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chairman & Managing Director, Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL); market cap ≈ US $275 B
- Architect of Jio’s 450 M-user telecom network and pan-India 5G rollout
- Steering RIL’s $10 B pivot toward green hydrogen, advanced battery storage, and bio-energy parks

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing global 6G testbeds with Qualcomm & Nokia; goal: blanket coverage ahead of Los Angeles Olympics 2028
- Accelerating Reliance Retail IPO roadmap; backstage negotiations to fold JioMart, Netmeds, and AJIO into a single consumer super-app
- Building a 5 GW green-hydrogen “Dhirubhai Ambani Energy Giga-Complex” in Jamnagar, with Saudi Aramco as co-investor
- Personal: grooming twins Isha & Akash as co-CEOs; carves Sunday mornings for discrete, three-hour Sanskrit tutoring—an antidote to boardroom intensity

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong cricket strategist; owns Mumbai Indians franchise but privately runs match-analysis simulations using in-house AI labs
- Collects post-Independence Indian art; curated a 40-piece Atul Dodiya exhibit for Antilia’s new sky gallery
- Surprising fact for host prompt: sketches speculative space habitats—keeps a leather notebook filled with rotating-torus designs inspired by Gerard K. O’Neill
- Guiding maxim: “Scale is India’s natural moat—own it, then reinvent it.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending to explore ultra-low-latency lunar-to-Earth data corridors compatible with Jio’s satellite constellation (launch window 2026)
- Wants candid insight on human-centered design for off-world experiences—how to translate Reliance’s consumer empire into extraterrestrial hospitality
- Brings value: deep pockets for infrastructure partnerships, India’s 140-million-viewer media channels for event storytelling, and a ready R&D bench for materials sourcing from lunar regolith

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to NASA’s Gateway logistics lead, SpaceX Starshield policy team, and Alain Ducasse’s culinary R&D director (for possible Mumbai-to-Moon gastronomy series)
- Attendees could assist by sharing edge-case human factors data (sleep cycles, taste profile shifts in low gravity) relevant to Reliance Retail’s planned “ExoMart” capsule stores
- Best engagement: invite him to a brief walk-through of the habitat’s life-support dashboard; segue into how distributed energy grids mirror Jamnagar’s green-hydrogen layout

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid lengthy discussion of domestic Indian telecom regulation—he delegates that to Manoj Modi
- Gauge appetite for philanthropic co-funding of lunar STEM scholarships; potential naming rights interest
- Follow-up Qs: timeline for satellite constellation spectrum auctions; openness to co-producing a docu-series on the inaugural lunar dinner experience
