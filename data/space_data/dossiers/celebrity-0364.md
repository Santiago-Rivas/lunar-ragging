### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Linus Torvalds

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Portland, Oregon; maintains summer cabin on the Lake District outside Helsinki
- Travels only 4–6 times per year—Kernel Summit, occasional scuba expeditions, and once-a-decade “must-see” tech milestones; the lunar dinner is one of those rare exceptions

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Principal Developer & Maintainer, Linux Kernel; Fellow, The Linux Foundation
- Inventor of Git, now the backbone of global software collaboration
- Key influence areas: open-source governance, large-scale distributed development, software supply-chain security

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Driving full Rust subsystem integration into the kernel for memory-safe modules by 2026-Q3
- Coordinating an industry task-force on verifiable build pipelines after recent supply-chain breaches
- Personally experimenting with ultra-low-power kernel profiles for off-planet hardware running on strict energy budgets
- Family project: mentoring his youngest daughter on building autonomous underwater drones; uses this to refine kernel sensor drivers

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate scuba diver; logs dives in remote cold-water sites, citing the “quiet, alien landscape” as brain reset therapy
- Collects vintage mechanical slide rules—claims they keep him “honest about computational efficiency”
- Guiding philosophy: “Code is a conversation; the compiler is just the moderator.”
- Surprising fact for the host’s question: he’s been practicing Finnish folk accordion for two years, strictly unplugged—says it forces patience he rarely exercises online

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Linux powers >90 % of space-grade computers; Torvalds keen to see how lunar habitats handle patch management and latency
- Wants candid dialogue on how closed-loop life-support data is shared: sees an open-source telemetry protocol as critical to off-world safety
- Ready to brainstorm “Zero-Gravity Git”—efficient commit workflows when latency to Earth hits seconds
- Brings decades-deep credibility and a pragmatic lens on collaboration models for teams separated by 384,000 km

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Artemis software reliability group; Starlink low-latency relay architecture leads; chefs experimenting with algorithmic nutrition planning
- Could benefit from meeting Planta’s immersive-experience designers to discuss human-machine feedback cycles for code review in VR
- Best engagement tactic: ask a pointed technical question, then segue into everyday human impact; avoid grandiose “change the world” platitudes

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- He despises polished sales pitches—prefers blunt honesty and humor
- Mild claustrophobia: appreciates transparent schedules and clear egress routes, even in pressurized modules
- Follow-up probe: Would he endorse a Moon-based bug-bounty program to harden life-critical software?
