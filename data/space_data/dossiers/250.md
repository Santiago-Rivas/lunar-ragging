### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Felix Auger-Aliassime

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Monte Carlo, Monaco (training hub & tax residence)
- Maintains family home in Montreal; off-season retreats to Porto-Novo, Benin for charity oversight
- Annual tour calendar keeps him on the road 30+ weeks; uses Paris and Miami as favored layover spots

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Top-tier ATP professional; peaked at World No. 4, currently holding steady inside Top 10
- Brand partner: TAG Heuer, Adidas, BNP Paribas, and most recently SpaceX’s Starlife program as “Athlete-in-Orbit” ambassador
- Key achievements:
  • Led Canada to first Davis Cup title (2022)  
  • 11 ATP titles, including back-to-back Masters 1000 wins in 2024  
  • Quarter-finalist or better at all four Grand Slams; 2025 Australian Open finalist

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Targeting first Grand Slam title before Paris 2026 Olympics; re-engineering serve biomechanics with AI-driven motion capture
- Expanding “FAAPointsForChange” initiative—goal: fund 30 schools in Togo by 2027
- Early-stage investor in regenerative food tech; evaluating low-gravity agriculture trials in partnership with NASA’s Deep Space Food Lab
- Personal: learning classical piano (Debussy pieces) as mental recovery tool; aims to perform publicly by year-end

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Space physiology fascinates him; has completed centrifuge and parabolic-flight sessions “for fun”
- Philosophy: “Process over outcome—stack small wins until the scoreboard can’t ignore you”
- Enjoys vintage photography; travels with a 1980s Leica M6 to document off-court life
- Surprising fact: competed in provincial chess tournaments as a teen—credits opening theory with enhancing on-court tactical thinking

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited as athletic voice on human performance in extreme environments; draws parallels between lunar gravity and injury-reduction protocols
- Seeking dialogue on lunar crop cultivation for his African school lunch programs—curious whether insights can translate to arid Sahel regions
- Offers star power, global youth reach, and potential content collaboration (short-form “Moon Rally” series: serves in 1/6 g)

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired:  
  • Dr. Jie Nakamura (JAXA micro-gravity nutrition lead)  
  • Tala Hamid (Founding GP, Impact Orbit Fund)  
  • Chef-astronaut Rena Patel on space-adapted high-protein menus
- In return: open to cameo activism campaigns, tennis masterclasses for sponsor VIPs, and cross-posting event highlights to 3.2 M followers
- Engaging approach: ask about his Leica shots or piano progress before tennis talk; offer data or anecdotes over abstract praise

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers French for nuanced discussions; English perfectly fluent but subtle humor shines in native tongue
- Avoid triggering topics: 2023 wrist injury setbacks—he feels narrative is over-played
- Follow-up angles: gauge interest in co-developing youth mental-health module within Planta’s metaverse, and confirm Q1 2026 off-season window for potential lunar-sim training content.
