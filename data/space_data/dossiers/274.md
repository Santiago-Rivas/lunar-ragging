### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Monica Seles

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: Sarasota, FL & Manhattan, NY
- Quarterly circuits through Melbourne, Paris, London, and New York during Grand Slam seasons for commentary and sponsor engagements
- Recent uptick in visits to Austin and Palo Alto—meetings with sports-tech founders and wearable-sensor labs

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Nine-time Grand Slam tennis champion; International Tennis Hall of Fame inductee
- Current roles: ESPN Grand Slam analyst, strategic advisor to Oura Health, angel investor in female-led wellness startups
- Authored two NYT-bestsellers (memoir & young-adult fiction); frequent keynote speaker on resilience and peak performance

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Beta-launching “GravityServe,” a mixed-reality tennis training platform exploring movement efficiency in low-gravity environments (partnership with MIT Media Lab, Q4 2025)
- Leading fundraising for “Second Set Foundation,” expanding mental-health resources for young athletes across 18 countries by 2026
- Personal: training for a symbolic exhibition rally in lunar-equivalent gravity at ESA’s Neutral Buoyancy Facility—wants to demonstrate the first legitimate topspin forehand “on the moon” by 2027
- Developing a children’s picture book on courage, illustrated by AI-generated art she co-directs

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Gourmet comfort-food cook: makes traditional Hungarian túrós palacsinta; experiments with dehydrated fruit fillings for space cuisine
- Collects mid-century matchbooks; appreciates objects that capture fleeting moments
- Guiding maxim: “The opponent lives in your head more than across the net—master that court first.”
- Enjoys silent meditation retreats; credits Vipassana practice for sustaining post-career creativity

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence underscores the intersection of elite sport, wellbeing, and human adaptation to non-Earth environments
- Seeks collaborators with expertise in vestibular neuroscience, motion-capture optics, and immersive audio to refine GravityServe for micro-g environments
- Will donate a signed racquet for the event’s charity auction and is open to a live VR demo showcasing lunar-trajectory ball physics
- Curious to discuss novel communal dining rituals—how shared meals recalibrate team dynamics in confined habitats

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Space Physiology Unit, Apple Vision Pro sports-partnerships lead, Serena Ventures wellness portfolio manager
- Attendees can assist by sharing data sets on muscle atrophy mitigation or offering beta-tester pools for adolescents
- Engaging hooks: ask about Hungarian space-inspired recipes; invite her to compare service-motion kinematics between Earth and lunar gravity on the base’s holo-court

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid dwelling on 1993 on-court attack unless she raises it—prefers forward-looking narratives around recovery
- Warm demeanour but values punctuality; seven-minute conversations that end on an actionable next step leave the best impression
- Follow-up question: gauge interest in co-hosting a “Mind-Body in Microgravity” podcast episode recorded live during lunar transit
