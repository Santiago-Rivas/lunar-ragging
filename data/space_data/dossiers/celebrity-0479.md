**FULL NAME:** Kevin Abstract

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Silver Lake, Los Angeles; secondary studio loft in Austin for writing retreats
- Regular circuits: NYC (film financing), Tokyo (streetwear collabs), and London (festival curation)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & former creative lead of multi-platinum hip-hop collective BROCKHAMPTON
- Founder & CEO, Video Store Pictures—cross-media studio producing music-driven film, VR, and graphic novels
- Grammy-nominated songwriter; Sundance NEXT Audience Award for debut feature “Helicopter Hearts” (2024)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Recording a concept album designed for zero-gravity acoustics; partnering with JPL acousticians for sonic testing
- Raising a $25 M seed round for “VERSE,” an immersive platform enabling fans to remix songs via spatial computing
- Personal mission: amplify queer voices in science-fiction storytelling; commissioning writers’ room anthology
- Quietly training for sub-orbital flight certification, aiming to film the first narrative music video shot in micro-gravity (target 2026)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Obsessive Lego architect—keeps a travel kit and builds models of every venue before performing
- Collects vintage Tamagotchi; claims nurturing digital pets taught him early empathy for online communities
- Guiding philosophy: “Radical transparency breeds radical connection.” Keeps a public Trello board of unfinished ideas
- Enjoys late-night chess streams; defeats fans under alias “FirstBoyOnMars”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to The First Dinner Party on the Moon as a proving ground for art created beyond Earth’s cultural gravity
- Seeking collaborators in XR hardware, closed-loop audio systems, and lunar interior lighting to stage a micro-concert during the dinner
- Eager to discuss psychological effects of off-planet isolation on creativity; looking for neuroscientists to co-author a white paper
- Offers: viral storytelling expertise, social reach (12 M combined followers), and a youthful narrative that can humanize lunar exploration

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Ideal introductions: SpaceX Starship cabin design team; Bose Spatial Audio R&D; MacArthur Fellows in neuroaesthetics
- Could mentor emerging artists on distributing content in decentralized networks—benefit to Planta’s future community platform
- Engage him with unconventional prompts (e.g., offer moon dust to incorporate into album art) and short, high-energy brainstorming bursts (15 min max)

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Values direct questions about purpose over career accolades; skip generic “What’s next?”
- Sensitive topic: past tension with major labels—focus on independence, not past legal battles
- Follow-up: confirm if his zero-gravity concept album needs beta listeners; Planta staff could record biometric responses mid-flight for his project
