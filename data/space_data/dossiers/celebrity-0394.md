### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Charles Hoskinson

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Wheatland, Wyoming – operates from a 12,000-acre ranch doubling as an R&D retreat
- Regular circuits: Denver (IOG engineering hub), Addis Ababa (Africa strategy), Dubai & Zug (investment partners), Tokyo (Cardano community)
- Known for “conference sprints”: 3–4 countries in 10 days when pushing ecosystem launches

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Input Output Global (IOG); architect of the Cardano blockchain (ADA ≈ $50 B FDV)
- Ethereum co-founder; exited 2014
- Advocate of peer-reviewed crypto research—40+ academic papers, first provably secure PoS protocol (Ouroboros)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Shipping Cardano’s “Voltaire” governance era—on-chain treasury disbursing $1 B-equivalent for community proposals
- Scaling layer-2 Hydra and “Midnight” privacy sidechain; courting Fortune 500 pilots for supply-chain transparency
- Africa focus: rolling out national-level digital ID + educational credential systems (Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria)
- Personal moonshot: converting ranch into zero-carbon agtech showcase (aquaponics + AI-driven water usage)
- Training for sub-orbital flight; views space presence as the next frontier for decentralized coordination

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Polymath hobbies: history of mathematics, Renaissance astronomy, Japanese calligraphy, breeding rare koi
- Enjoys debating Aristotelian ethics over single-malt; favorite maxim: “Systems outlive kings—design the system.”
- Unusual fact: builds custom steampunk pocket watches—hand-serts 19th-century movements into titanium cases from his CNC shop

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees lunar dinner as a live sandbox to test blockchain-based governance for off-world communities
- Wants to explore tokenizing lunar resource rights, autonomous supply ledgers, and identity frameworks for transient crews
- Offers: turnkey PoS network deployable on low-bandwidth mesh, academic contacts to validate safety/security protocols
- Curious about Planta’s sensor suite; considering partnership to feed environmental data into Cardano oracle layer

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros sought: SpaceX Starship life-support team, Blue Origin’s lunar logistics lead, ESA legal counsel on extraterrestrial property
- Helpful assets: datasets on closed-loop agriculture, edge-compute hardware tolerant to radiation
- Engage him by proposing a rapid “governance game”—map meal courses to resource-allocation votes; appeals to his love of playful formality

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid Ethereum tribalism chatter; prefers future-focused collaboration
- Time-bounded: allocates only 20 min slots—secure follow-up with his chief of staff, Tamara Haasen, on-site
- Potential deep-dive Q’s: How will Midnight reconcile privacy with export-control rules on the Moon? Can ranch-based aquaponics models inform lunar biomes?
