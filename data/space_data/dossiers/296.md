### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Daniel Ek

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Stockholm; secondary work loft in London’s Soho for EU policy proximity  
- Monthly shuttles to New York & Los Angeles to keep pulse on creator economy and label relations  
- Quiet retreat house in the Åre mountains—48-hour “phone-off” stints every six weeks to reset  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & CEO, Spotify (600 M+ MAUs; now the largest podcast platform globally)  
- Co-founder, Prima Materia—€1 B evergreen fund backing deep-tech and European defense/energy resilience  
- Key achievements: Pioneered freemium streaming model; shepherded 2024 EU “Creator Equity Act” enabling direct fan payments  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing “Supremium” hi-fidelity tier with adaptive spatial audio & on-device AI remix tools  
- Incubating internal “Project Echo”—ultra-low-latency voice chat layer that can mesh with AR headsets and, eventually, extraterrestrial habitats  
- Prima Materia eyeing Series B in H2 Green Steel and a stealth photonics company for quantum-safe networking  
- Personal ambition: compose and release an ambient instrumental EP under a pseudonym by end-2026—testing Spotify’s anonymous artist onboarding flow  
- Preparing 2026 family relocation experiment: 3-month stay in Kyoto to immerse children in non-Western education models  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong coder; still commits to internal hack projects quarterly (“keeps BS detector sharp”)  
- Passionate about open-sourced biofeedback wearables—uses HRV data to schedule critical meetings  
- Reads Stoic philosophy; favorite line: “The obstacle is the way” (Marcus Aurelius)  
- Off-beat fact: keeps a vintage Lear Siegler ADM-3A terminal in his office, boots it for focus sessions  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Intrigued by acoustic physics of low-gravity environments—wants to test spatial audio algorithms inside the lunar dome  
- Seeks dialogue on “emotional telemetry” in group settings: capturing biometric signals to score adaptive background music mid-dinner  
- Brings: ability to livestream the meal to 50 M Spotify Live listeners, turning event into the first off-world social-audio broadcast  
- Desires connections with habitat architects to study wall resonance and materials for built-in sound stages  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros: NASA Artemis comms team, Bose AR R&D, venture leads at SpaceX Starlink for bandwidth trials  
- Helpful offers: can provide curated astronaut-themed playlists and promotion on Spotify’s global homepage  
- Engagement tip: Ask about his “silent Saturdays” ritual—he’ll light up explaining how sensory deprivation fuels product ideas  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid touchy topic of 2023 Joe Rogan controversy—fatigue factor high  
- Potential follow-up: gauge interest in co-funding a micro-gravity artist residency at the lunar base  
- Confidential curiosity: Is Project Echo coded to comply with ICT lunar spectrum allotments?—worth probing discreetly
