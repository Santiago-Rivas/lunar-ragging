### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Sara Blakely

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Atlanta, GA; maintains creative studio loft in NYC’s SoHo for design sprints
- Quarterly “curiosity tours” to Tokyo, Tel Aviv, and Reykjavík scouting textile innovation
- Recently completed Virgin Galactic sub-orbital training; comfortable with micro-gravity environments

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Executive Chair, Spanx Inc. (majority stake sold to Blackstone 2021; remains brand steward)
- General Partner, Blakely Ventures Fund I ($250 M) backing female-led consumer tech and circular-economy apparel
- Philanthropic arm (Blakely Foundation) has deployed $120 M toward women’s entrepreneurship and crisis response

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Incubating “SPX-Zero,” a fully recyclable, compression-adaptive garment line designed for low-gravity travel; first prototypes due Q4 2026
- Building a mixed-reality masterclass on failure-driven creativity; pilot filming June 2025
- Exploring equity investments in lunar regolith-based fiber manufacturing to close the loop on in-situ clothing production
- Personally committed to spend 90 days in 2025 on stand-up and improv stages to “refill the humor tank” after the Blackstone exit

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong notebook journaler—keeps a running list titled “Biggest Mistakes & Hidden Gifts”
- Amateur magician; carries a custom deck and enjoys impromptu card tricks to break the ice
- Guiding maxim: “The sooner you laugh at yourself, the sooner everyone else will laugh with you, not at you.”
- Enjoys freediving and breath-work—swears by “static breath holds” for ideation bursts

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending to test SPX-Zero fabrics in 1/6 g and gather sensory feedback during dinner activities
- Keen to discuss social-commerce opportunities on lunar livestreams; curious how Planta’s platform captures emotional telemetry
- Offers humor-driven storytelling segment for the program (“What Spanx taught me about lunar gravity”) to energize guests

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros sought to: 
  • bio-polymer or mycelium fiber scientists 
  • lunar habitat architects focused on circular waste streams 
  • Angel networks funding female space founders
- Could mentor early-stage founders in Planta’s accelerator on branding through constraint
- Best engagement tactics: invite her to co-design a spontaneous “moon-walk catwalk” showcasing improvised garments; follow with concrete ask

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers unscripted, first-name conversations; status symbols are a turn-off
- Loves being asked “What failure do you celebrate most?”—opens a candid rapport
- Sensitive topic: politely deflects talk on net-worth rankings; spotlight should stay on impact
- Follow-up: gauge interest in joining Planta’s Visionary Council; flag potential collaboration on zero-gravity fashion content series
