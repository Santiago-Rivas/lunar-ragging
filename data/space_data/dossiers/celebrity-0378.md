### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jensen Huang

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Silicon Valley (Los Altos Hills); secondary apartment in Taipei for supply-chain and family visits  
- Predictable migration pattern around quarterly GTC keynotes, with add-on stops in Austin, Cambridge (UK), and Hsinchu to brief research teams

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder, President & CEO, NVIDIA Corporation (market cap > $1 T)  
- Architect of the CUDA ecosystem and leading voice behind accelerated computing for AI, robotics, and climate science  
- Personal market sway: a single product roadmap slide can shift semiconductor valuations globally

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Fast-tracking Blackwell-Next GPU compute modules and modular data-center “pods” that tolerate lunar radiation levels  
- Steering a $10 B “AI-for-Science” initiative—time-allocated with U.S. DOE labs and European HPC consortia  
- Personal moon-shot: a 2030 goal to 10× reduce the energy per inference for foundation models  
- Quiet exploration of joint venture fabs in Vietnam and Arizona to diversify away from Taiwan risk  
- Writing a short memoir “Warp Speed Management” during red-eye flights—intends to self-publish digital-only

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong table-tennis competitor; travels with a collapsible carbon-fiber paddle (“my stress test for latency”)  
- Collects custom Italian motorcycles—insists the hum of a Ducati at 13 000 RPM “sounds like parallel threads syncing”  
- Favorite maxim: “The future is accelerated; the question is whether you are.”  
- Enjoys cooking Taiwanese street-food classics for small groups—knows the chemistry of oyster-omelet starch by heart

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a test-bed for extreme-edge AI and real-time collaboration avatars powered by NVIDIA CloudXR  
- Wants candid feedback on how micro-gravity affects human perception in VR—data for a forthcoming HoloPresence SDK  
- Offering to provision a compact DGX-Lunar pod (liquid-cooled, radiation-shielded) for the base’s research outpost  
- Curious about novel agricultural photobioreactors; exploring GPU-optimized models for algae-based life-support

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to:  
  • Artemis mission planners (to align compute roadmaps)  
  • Michelin-star chef Dominique Crenn (for a moon-menu AI co-creation project)  
  • Textile innovators developing radiation-resistant smart fabrics for spacesuits  
- Attendees can assist by contributing edge-case datasets (low-gravity locomotion, lunar regolith handling) for model training  
- Engage him with thoughtful “what if” scenarios—then pivot to concrete engineering obstacles; he dislikes abstract futurism without execution pathways

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive angle: balancing U.S. export controls with unabated China revenue—avoid on-record probes  
- Surprising tidbit aligned with conversation goal: at age 12 he placed 3rd in a national soap-box derby; still keeps the car in his garage and tinkers on it Sunday mornings  
- Follow-up: gauge his interest in co-funding an open-source “Lunar Compute Commons” to democratize access for academic teams worldwide
