### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Bjarne Stroustrup

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Manhattan, New York City  
- Maintains apartment in Copenhagen; summers spent on Denmark’s Djursland coast  
- Regular shuttle: NYC ↔ London (ISO C++ committee), annual teaching week in Tokyo  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Managing Director & Technical Fellow, Morgan Stanley Technology Division  
- Distinguished Research Professor, Columbia University Computer Science  
- Inventor of the C++ programming language; 35 M+ developers use derivative toolchains  
- Author of “The C++ Programming Language” (4 M copies) and “A Tour of C++”  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Leading Morgan Stanley’s initiative to harden low-latency trading code with “Safety-Profiled C++” (SP-C++)—memory-safe, formally verified subsets  
- Steering C++26 standard proposals: module-based build graph, zero-cost deterministic concurrency, and lifetime-tracked pointers  
- Drafting a concise memoir on the human side of language design—working title: “Simple ≠ Easy”  
- Personally experimenting with compile-time lenses for photogrammetry on embedded RISC-V boards—potential spin-off open-source project in 2026  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Long-distance cycling; logs 3 000 km each summer along Danish coastal routes  
- Restores vintage mechanical cameras; prefers Ilford HP5 film over digital for “discipline in composition”  
- Believes “software is clay for ideas—dangerous when wet, powerful when fired”  
- Surprising detail: built a functioning 8-bit CPU from discrete transistors in high school; still keeps it on his office shelf and powers it up annually on his birthday  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to critique Planta’s real-time collaboration stack for lunar latency (2.6 s round-trip) using SP-C++ principles  
- Curious about radiation-induced bit-flips in ARM cores; wants dialogue with habitat avionics teams  
- Offers historical perspective on designing languages for constrained environments—thinks the Moon base “is the new embedded”  
- Intent on testing whether microgravity changes cognitive flow during code reviews—ready to participate in any live coding demonstrations  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to:  
  • SpaceX Starlink Edge Computing lead (on-orbit compute nodes)  
  • MIT Media Lab’s “Gravity-Lab” neuroscientists studying cognition in low-g  
  • Investors exploring toolchains for safety-critical autonomous systems  
- Could mentor early-stage founders building compile-time analysis tools; open to angel tickets up to $250 k when technical thesis aligns  
- Engage him with concrete technical challenges or thoughtful philosophical questions; avoid generic “C++ is hard” complaints  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Dislikes buzzwords—prefers data and clear problem statements  
- Mild hearing loss in left ear; choose quiet corner for nuanced discussion  
- Follow-up: Share post-dinner white-paper draft on lunar latency mitigation (he agreed to give annotated feedback within two weeks)
