### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Chance the Rapper (Chancelor Johnathan Bennett)

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Chicago’s South Side; maintains studio loft in West Loop
- Splits time between Chicago, Los Angeles, and Accra (Ghana) for recording sessions and social-impact work
- Rarely travels for “standard” industry events—prefers purpose-driven gatherings; 2027 lunar trip appeals to his “first-of-its-kind” instincts

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Independent hip-hop artist, 3× Grammy winner; pioneer of the streaming-first release model
- Founder, SocialWorks – Chicago nonprofit funneling ~$15 M into public-school arts & mental-health programs
- Executive producer of the forthcoming animated series “Bennett Park,” blending Chicago folklore with Afrofuturism

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Recording a concept album, “Skylines,” inspired by celestial imagery; targeting Q4 2026 release with immersive AR visuals
- Scaling House of Kicks, a hybrid sneaker-design incubator & youth entrepreneurship fund (recent Nike collab sold out in 4 min)
- Deepening Ghana–Chicago cultural exchange: planning 2026 Accra music festival with local NGOs
- Personally exploring zero-gravity vocal techniques after short parabolic-flight sessions—keen to capture live vocals in lunar low-grav

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur cartographer; collects 19th-century maps of Great Lakes shipping routes (“Chicago’s first hip-hop started on the water”)
- Plays 3D chess variants; claims the game keeps his rap cadences unpredictable
- Guiding philosophy: “Art is a civic service”; measures success by community impact rather than chart position
- Favorite quote: “Do not despise the day of small beginnings” (Zechariah 4:10)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to Planta’s thesis of “community beyond Earth”—mirrors his Afrofuturist album narrative
- Eager to swap ideas on using space venues for philanthropic storytelling (micro-documentary? live charitable stream from the Moon)
- Wants candid conversations about mental health in extreme environments; considering fundraiser for astronaut-family support programs
- Offers musical improv set during dinner—floating verses while guests eat in partial gravity

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros sought: SpaceX Inspiration4 media team (for joint charity broadcast), ESA astronaut Dr. Samantha Cristoforetti (mental-health insights), Nike Spacewear R&D lead
- Could mentor emerging creators in Planta’s network on independent monetization models
- Best engagement: Ask him to freestyle using lunar-inspired word prompts; segue into map collection or parabolic-flight stories for deeper connection

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Prefers to avoid lengthy discussions about major-label deals; values his indie status
- Unusual fact prompt: He is mastering the kora (21-string West African harp) and plans to sample it live on the Moon—mentioning it will delight him
- Follow-up: Gauge interest in co-designing a limited “Sea of Tranquility” sneaker drop benefiting Chicago arts programs
