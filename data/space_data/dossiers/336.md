### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jim Sinegal

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Seattle, WA
- Regular travel loop: San Diego (family & alma mater), Bentonville (supply-chain think tank), occasional trips to Singapore & Tokyo to advise APAC retail partners  
- Maintains “store-floor tour” habit—unannounced walkthroughs of Costco warehouses every quarter to stay grounded in frontline reality

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & former CEO, Costco Wholesale (1983–2012); architect of the high-volume/low-margin membership model now studied in 30+ MBA programs  
- Current roles: Senior Advisor, Costco board; Chair, Sinegal Family Foundation; Visiting Fellow, Stanford Center for Supply-Chain Innovation  
- Key influence: Pioneered employee-first wage policies that proved profitability of high retention in retail

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Philanthropy: Scaling a $250 M “Talent Uplift Fund” to expand community college logistics programs across the U.S.  
- Research collaboration with Blue Origin and MIT Media Lab on ultra-efficient lunar-to-Earth supply corridors—aims to adapt Costco’s bulk-purchasing algorithms to extra-terrestrial contexts  
- Personal ambition: Publish memoir-plus-playbook “Cost Matters” by late 2026; targeting younger founders who conflate growth with complexity

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong jazz vinyl collector—travels with a curated USB archive of 1950s live sets; happy to swap bootlegs over dinner  
- Guiding maxim: “Culture isn’t what you preach—it’s what you tolerate.”  
- Enjoys surprising people with his background as a onetime steel-mill welder; credits that job for his obsession with hard hats and warehouse safety rules  
- Practices daily tai chi to counteract lingering back issues; intrigued by how lunar gravity might improve range of motion

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevant because: Proven master of moving goods cheaply and reliably—essential knowledge for any sustainable lunar community  
- Seeking dialogue on:  
  • Designing member-owned cooperatives for off-world settlements  
  • Cross-industry standards for transparent sourcing of rare-earth elements harvested on the Moon  
- Brings: Decades-deep playbook on pricing discipline, workforce morale, and vendor negotiation that can translate to closed-loop lunar ecosystems

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros desired:  
  • Planta Network’s XR social architects (to test “virtual warehouse walk-throughs”)  
  • SpaceX Starship cargo planners exploring cost-plus membership freight models  
- Attendees can help by sharing: Failure stories from early lunar habitat supply chains—he’s drawn to operational glitches more than success tales  
- Engaging him: Ask “What injustice in retail still bothers you most?”; he lights up discussing fair-wage math and will segue into bold problem-solving

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- At 91 during event; mobility fine but prefers fewer stairs—lunar low-g helps, yet arrange a handrail near dining area for confidence  
- Sensitive topic: He deflects compliments on personal net worth; keeps focus on company culture and frontline workers  
- Follow-up questions:  
  • Status of Blue Origin/MIT pilot on just-in-time lunar warehousing  
  • Whether the memoir will include annotated copies of his internal Costco “do the right thing” memos
