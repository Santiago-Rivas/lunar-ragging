### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Michelle Simmons

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Sydney, Australia (UNSW Kensington campus & Silicon Quantum Computing HQ)
- Maintains crash-pads in Palo Alto and London; 10–12 trans-Pacific trips annually
- Routinely schedules “48-hour sprints” in Washington DC and Brussels to brief policymakers on quantum-security standards

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Silicon Quantum Computing Pty Ltd.; Scientia Professor of Quantum Physics, UNSW
- Achievements:
  • Built world’s first single-atom transistor (2012)  
  • 2018 Australian of the Year; Fellow of Royal Society (UK)  
  • Leads team that produced a 10-qubit silicon integrated circuit (2024) now benchmarked as industry best for coherence time

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Engineering a 100-qubit, error-corrected silicon chip by mid-2027—milestone for commercial launch
- Securing $250 M Series B to expand atomic-precision fabrication line; courting sovereign wealth funds plus two U.S. aerospace primes
- Personal: training for her 5th Rottnest Channel Swim; experimenting with microgravity lithography concepts in parabolic flights

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Open-water swimming & coastal conservation advocate; claims daily ocean dips sharpen “pattern-recognition instincts”
- Collects 17th-century scientific instruments; her office houses an original Hooke microscope
- Guiding maxim: “If you can image a single atom, you can engineer civilisation’s next leap.”
- Fascinated by the psychology of exploration—keeps diaries analyzing similarities between early polar expeditions and quantum research teams

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending to explore radiation-hardened quantum processors for lunar comms and on-site cryptography
- Seeking collaborators on regolith-derived silicon purification; open to experimental fab trials inside lunar vacuum chambers
- Offers: lightning talk on “Quantum Key Distribution from the Sea of Tranquility” and real-time demo of a portable single-electron pump

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Artemis systems engineers (radiation shielding), ESA secure-comm leads, Blue Origin Orbital Reef R&D head
- Attendees can assist by providing microgravity test slots, satellite bandwidth for QKD experiments, or data on lunar thermal cycles
- Engage her with questions about antique lab gear, extreme swimming logistics, or her teenage aspiration to become an Olympic rower—she lights up when parallels are drawn between athletic discipline and quantum error correction

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Balances dual roles (academic & CEO) meticulously; avoid framing them as conflicting
- IPO rumors circulate for 2029—she deflects politely; focus on technical milestones instead
- Sensitive to discussions of UK research funding cuts post-Brexit
- Follow-up query worth posing: her preliminary results on atomically precise lithography performed during Zero-G flights—and what a permanent lunar fab could unlock
