### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Andy Murray

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Surrey, UK (family home)  
- Secondary base: Barcelona training facility; frequent travel to ATP events, exhibition matches, and BBC commentary gigs  
- Pattern: 7–10 day micro-trips, always returns home for family weekends; accepts long-haul only when it folds in philanthropic or tech-investor meetings

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Three-time Grand Slam champion, double Olympic gold medallist, former ATP World No. 1  
- Founder, 77 Sports Management & 77 Ventures (early-stage fund backing health, wearables, and climate-tech)  
- Lead ambassador, LTA “Advantage All” mental-health program; on-air analyst for Wimbledon and Australian Open

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Final competitive push through 2026 “farewell circuit,” targeting select grass & indoor hard-court events  
- Scaling 77 Ventures’ £40 M Fund II; eyeing deep-space physiology sensors and regenerative agriculture startups  
- Co-developing an injury-analytics AI with Cambridge spin-out NeuralMotion to license across pro sports  
- Personal: carving out month-long sabbatical each year to be present for his four children’s milestones; experimenting with plant-based nutrition to extend joint health

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Closet astronomy buff—keeps a portable reflector telescope on tour; quotes Carl Sagan unironically  
- Builds mechanical watches from kits to decompress; fascinated by timekeeping in variable-gravity environments  
- Credo: “Control the controllables, tolerate the chaos.” Mentally rehearses high-stakes points while submerged in an ice bath to simulate sensory deprivation  
- Enjoys prank chess blitz sessions under a pseudonym on Lichess (rating ~2100)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Sea of Tranquility venue as a once-in-a-lifetime test bed for low-gravity athletic movement; curious about designing the first lunar tennis volley demo  
- Seeks dialogue on hydroponic crop cycles—potential tie-in with his foundation’s school-garden initiative  
- Brings celebrity halo, global media pull, and a disciplined athlete’s perspective on resilience and teamwork in extreme environments  
- Wants to leave the dinner with one “moonshot” collaboration bridging sport, wellbeing, and frontier tech

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: SpaceX life-science team, Patagonia’s Earth Fund, and any startup prototyping bio-feedback wearables for astronauts  
- Offers: headline participation in promo content, mentoring founders on performance psychology, and match-experience packages for top donors  
- Engage him by probing the biomechanics of movement in 1/6 g and the logistics of reliable backhand topspin on regolith; avoid small talk about past injuries—focus on forward-looking tech

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: ongoing hip micro-fracture monitoring; prefers standing or slow pacing over prolonged sitting—plan seating accordingly on the lunar surface  
- Surprising hook (per conversation goals): he bakes sourdough with a 12-year-old starter named “Björn”; eager to test fermentation rates in reduced gravity  
- Follow-up question: Would he serve as athlete-advisor for Planta’s planned “Lunar Games” side event in 2028?
