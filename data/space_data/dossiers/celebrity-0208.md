### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Aitana Bonmatí

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Barcelona, Spain (Gràcia neighborhood); maintains quiet retreat in Cadaqués for recovery blocks  
- Annual travel loop: UEFA Champions League fixtures across Europe, winter conditioning stints in Los Angeles, national-team camps in Madrid & Seville

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Central midfielder & vice-captain, FC Barcelona Femení; captain, Spain Women’s National Team  
- 2023 Ballon d’Or Féminin; back-to-back UEFA Women’s Player of the Year 2023–24  
- Brand partner: Adidas “Predator” line, Allianz sustainability ambassador, MasterClass instructor on spatial awareness in sport

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Chasing a third consecutive continental treble with Barça (Liga F, Copa de la Reina, UWCL)  
- Building the Bonmatí Foundation: grants for girls’ football academies that blend STEM curricula and design thinking  
- Research collaboration with Barcelona Supercomputing Center on AI-driven workload management to extend athletes’ peak performance to 2030  
- Personal ambition: earn a postgraduate certificate in Space Physiology (remote course with King’s College London) ahead of the 2027 Moon appearance

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Off-pitch passions: hand-thrown ceramics (sells limited runs for charity), Catalan modernist poetry, and experimental plant-based gastronomy  
- Practises Wim Hof breathing + cold-water swims; credits routine for “90-minute clarity”  
- Guiding philosophy: “La intuición se entrena” (“intuition is trained”)—emphasizes deliberate pattern recognition over raw speed  
- Little-known quirk: collects soil vials from every stadium played; intends to add lunar regolith to the series

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence signals human-performance narrative for Planta’s lunar vision; offers relatable icon bridging elite sport, creativity, and exploration  
- Seeks dialogue on micro-gravity training adaptations, circadian rhythm management off-Earth, and how immersive tech can democratize women’s sport fandom  
- Prepared to film a short “first touch on the Moon” skill sequence—viral content for both Planta and UEFA’s #PlayAnywhere campaign  
- Interested in co-developing a STEM-athletics curriculum using lunar data sets to inspire schoolchildren

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros valued: ESA Human Factors team, Nike’s former lunar-sole R&D lead Mattias Holm, philanthropist Melinda French Gates for foundation scaling  
- Attendees with VR/AR expertise can pitch fan-engagement layers for live women’s matches viewed from orbit  
- Best engagement tactic: challenge her with a creative constraint (e.g., design a 5-a-side pitch in 1/6 g); she thrives on rapid ideation sprints

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Politely deflects RFEF power-struggle chatter—keep focus on future, not federation politics  
- Prefers conversations in English or Catalan; Spanish press fatigue evident  
- Follow-up probe: details of her AI workload dashboard—data-sharing possibilities with Planta’s human-optimization group  
- Secure small ceramic wheel access on lunar base if possible; offering her clay “studio corner” would be a memorable gesture
