- Negotiating post-playing role with England FA focused on elite-pathway diversity  
- Personal: Completing a part-time MSc in Space Physiology (King’s College London) to study musculoskeletal adaptation in micro-gravity—ambition to design the first “lunar-capable” football training regimen

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Secret hobby: Writes Python scripts that parse GPS data from training sessions to generate custom heat-maps (loves geospatial visualization)  
- Passionate amateur astrophotographer; her Instagram “hidden” alt account posts lunar time-lapses shot from Montserrat  
- Favorite maxim: “Pressure is privilege—change the environment, keep the standard.”  
- Enjoys experimental cuisine; collects hot sauces from every away trip (54 bottles and counting)

- Sensitive angle: Long-term knee cartilage preservation—avoid casual inquiries about retirement timelines  
- Follow-up questions:  
  1. Progress on MSc thesis—any preliminary findings on plyometrics in reduced gravity?  
  2. Interest in co-hosting a youth “Moon Ball” outreach program with Planta Network post-event?
