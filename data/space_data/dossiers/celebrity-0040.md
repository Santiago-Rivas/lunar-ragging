- Regular tour loop: London ↔ Dubai ↔ Singapore every spring; Washington, DC drop-ins tied to criminal-justice advocacy
- Keeps a week per quarter “off-grid” in Napa Valley songwriting retreat—no socials, minimal staff contact

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Singer-songwriter, producer, and co-founder, Get Lifted Film Co (Peacock’s “The Best Man: Final Chapters,” Netflix’s “Jingle Jangle”)
- Founder, LOVED01 Skincare—clinically tested line for melanin-rich skin, scaling into APAC duty-free channels
- One of only 19 EGOT holders; 12 Grammys, Oscar for “Glory,” Tony for “Jitney,” Emmy for “Jesus Christ Superstar Live”

- Executive-producing Broadway revival of “Soul Train,” aiming for 2026-27 season
- Personal: refining zero-gravity breath control exercises with SpaceX medical team—wants first live vocal performance in lunar gravity

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Obsessive about vintage typewriters—owns a 1939 Hermes Baby he uses for first lyric drafts; enjoys discussing tactile creativity in a digital age
- Weekend chess player; favors aggressive King’s Gambit—believes “bold openings set the tone for collaborative risk-taking”
- Lifelong tech optimist: invests quietly in carbon-negative cement and cultured-protein startups
- Surprising fact he loves sharing: spent a year as a management consultant at BCG straight out of UPenn before music took off

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as testbed for “music as connective tissue” in extraterrestrial settings; wants to gauge acoustic properties of lunar habitats
- Seeks dialogues with food-tech teams on multisensory dining to pair with live performance
- Can contribute an impromptu micro-set or co-write an event anthem; willing to host a post-dinner “Songs in the Sea of Tranquility” recording session

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Artemus comms lead; Blue Origin’s payload experiences director; Planta’s hydroponic R&D chief for skincare botanicals
- Attendees could assist by offering VR-capture tech for his album’s immersive release and cross-promoting criminal-justice reform NFTs
- Engage him by proposing a joint experiment: record guests’ heartbeats in lunar gravity and weave them into a closing chord progression

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers authenticity over star-struck praise—lead with purpose, not accolades
- Avoid touching on recent social-media controversies surrounding spouse; keep focus on future projects
- Follow-up query: confirm his interest in donating concert proceeds to lunar research scholarships—he hinted at a “Moonshot Music Fund” but details still fluid
