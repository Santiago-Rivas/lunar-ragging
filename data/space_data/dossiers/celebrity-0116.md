### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Eddie Redmayne

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Primrose Hill, London; family retreat in Wiltshire countryside  
- Regular circuits: West End stages, New York for Broadway revivals, Los Angeles during awards season  
- Typically clusters travel around theatrical runs to minimize time away from wife Hannah and their two children  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Acclaimed actor & producer; Academy Award, Tony, BAFTA, Olivier winner  
- Recent spotlight: Emcee in “Cabaret” (London & NYC transfers), drawing record box-office and critical acclaim  
- Executive producer on upcoming limited series “The Warburg Files” (Apple TV+) exploring art restitution  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Developing an immersive XR performance piece that blends live theatre with real-time volumetric capture—seeking tech partners now  
- Early discussions with ESA about a children’s docu-series on space exploration and neuro-diversity, inspired by his ALS advocacy through the Stephen Hawking Foundation  
- Sharpening his fashion line collaboration with Alexander McQueen; sustainable textiles are non-negotiable  
- Personal goal: complete a private pilot’s license by mid-2026 to feel the “discipline of precision Hawking envied in astronauts”  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur astrophotographer; owns a 14-inch Dobsonian he wheels onto the Wiltshire pasture for deep-sky captures  
- Rugby fanatic (Harlequins supporter) and quietly funds a youth inclusion program in South London  
- Collects vintage Patek Philippe pocket watches—loves the metaphor of time as both stage direction and character  
- Guiding maxim borrowed from Hawking: “Quiet minds do not yield brilliant futures.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar setting dovetails with his public association to cosmology post-“Theory of Everything” and private fascination with low-gravity choreography  
- Seeks dialogue on:  
  • Storytelling frameworks that resonate in non-Earth environments  
  • Sustainability of off-world cultural events (waste management, food sourcing)  
  • Potential partnership for broadcasting an XR musical number live from the Moon in 2030  
- Value add: Celebrity draw, articulate spokesperson for blending arts & sciences, fluent at translating complex ideas to mass audiences  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: Planta’s XR engineering lead, SpaceX’s entertainment liaison, and Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard (re sustainable fabrics)  
- Offers mentorship to early-stage creators exploring narrative design in microgravity or VR theatre  
- Engage him with tactile demos (e.g., haptic gloves, low-latency hologram rig) rather than slide decks; he responds to sensory immediacy  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers informal, small-group conversations—avoid red-carpet atmospherics  
- Respect privacy: no photography of children or questions about family schedules  
- Surprising fact prompt: He can blindfold-solve a Rubik’s Cube in under 90 seconds—learned backstage during “Red” run  
- Follow-up query worth exploring: Would he lend voice talent to Planta’s AI “storyteller” module for lunar habitats?
