- Primary base: Wat Phra Dhammakaya, Pathum Thani, Thailand

- Personal focus: encoding his 4,000 hours of Dhamma talks into “DhammaAI,” a multilingual large-language model for contemplative guidance  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Fascinated by sacred geometry; studies golden-ratio harmonics in domed habitats—expects lunar architecture to be the next frontier for “living mandalas”  
- Hydroponic saffron cultivation enthusiast; believes its aroma stabilizes attention during long meditations  
- Guiding maxim: “A still mind is the ultimate technology—everything else is firmware.”  
- Leisure quirk: Sketches calligraphy upside-down to test proprioceptive mindfulness—perfect zero-G conversation starter  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Handpicked to lead the inaugural “Earthrise Metta” meditation on the observation deck at 05:11 UTC  
- Seeking collaborators to embed micro-meditation cues into Planta’s social-connectivity wearables  
- Offers experiential insight on group cohesion rituals—valuable for multi-national lunar crews and off-world settlements  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Behavioral Health & Performance team; Axiom Space life-support designers; Obvious Ventures (mental-wellness fund)  
- Attendees can assist with: immersive-audio engineers to spatialize chanting for low-gravity acoustics; translators for Sanskrit–Mandarin corpus ingestion  
- Best engagement setting: quiet walk through the hydroponic garden—ask about geometric crop patterns or his upside-down calligraphy practice  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Thai legal matters remain unresolved; avoid public discussion—private briefings possible if framed around “legacy stewardship”  
- Address him as “Luang Por” with palms joined; tactile contact is discouraged  
- Mild hearing loss in left ear—stand to his right during conversation  
- Follow-up Qs: interest level in a permanent lunar dhamma hall; willingness to curate an interfaith silent retreat on the dark side during next lunar cycle
