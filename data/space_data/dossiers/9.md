### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Naval Ravikant

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Presidio Heights, San Francisco
- Secondary retreats: Maui (winter) & Austin (spring conference season)
- Predictable travel loop: Dubai → Singapore → New Delhi each quarter to scout frontier-tech founders and longevity clinics

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & chairman-emeritus, AngelList; quietly steers policy on “open-access angel investing” worldwide
- Managing partner, Long-Haul Ventures (family office deploying $2 B across crypto, AI bio, and off-planet infrastructure)
- Author of “The Almanack of Naval Ravikant” (3 M+ copies) and host of the NAV.AL micro-podcast

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Structuring an on-chain, continuously raisable “Angel Roll-Up Fund” targeting moon-shot ventures outside Earth’s jurisdiction
- Incubating “ReputationOS,” a decentralized identity layer designed for autonomous habitats and digital nomad visa programs
- Drafting second book, “The Builders’ Way,” exploring synthesis of stoicism, wealth creation, and cosmic expansion
- Personal: pushing VO2 max past 55 via sprint triathlon training; monitoring epigenetic age with the goal of subtracting two biological years by 2027

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Daily 60-minute Vipassana practice; attends a 10-day silent retreat every quarter—claims it yields his highest ROI
- Collects hand-copied Greek stoic fragments; favorite maxim: “Escape competition through authenticity”
- Enthusiastic about barefoot sprinting on unusual terrain—interested to test “lunar sand” for gait efficiency
- Fascinated by cuisines that use zero-soil agriculture; experiments with home-grown spirulina smoothies

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a live case study for self-governing micro-societies and resource-frugal hospitality
- Wants candid dialogue on tokenizing lunar land grants, closed-loop food systems, and mental health protocols in confined habitats
- Brings depth in early-stage capital, global founder network, and a talent for distilling complex ideas into tweet-length memes—ideal for amplifying the event’s narrative

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to: 
  • Blue Origin life-support R&D leads  
  • Michelin 3-star chefs experimenting with 3D-printed organics  
  • ESA psychologists studying isolation resilience
- Attendees can help by sharing preliminary data on low-gravity effects on mitochondrial function
- High-engagement approach: invite him for a low-gravity walk and ask, “What’s something unusual about you that almost nobody knows?”—he enjoys flipping that prompt back on the asker

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers sparse, distraction-free settings; suggest meeting in the observation dome rather than the crowded dining ring
- Avoid politics, focus on first-principles problem-solving
- Follow-up probe: gauge his interest in co-hosting a “Founders in Space” mini-series leveraging the event’s recorded insights
