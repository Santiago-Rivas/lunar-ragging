### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Bayo Akomolafe

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Chennai, India (family home); maintains writer’s studio in Lagos, Nigeria
- Spends 4-5 months/year on lecture circuits across North America & Europe; recent residencies in Rotterdam and Vancouver
- Known for choosing “slow routes” (train, cargo ship) to honour his “deceleration” ethic—except when rockets are involved

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Philosopher-poet & founder, The Emergence Network (global post-activism collective, 150+ fellows in 22 countries)
- Visiting Professor of Practice, Union Theological Seminary (NYC) & Research Fellow, Rice University Center for Environmental Studies
- Author of “These Wilds Beyond Our Fences” and forthcoming “The Black Soil of the Moon” (2026)  
  • Recipient, 2024 Climate Story Award for narrative collaboration on the film “Shikakwa”  
  • TED main-stage alumnus; frequent advisor to UN “Harmony with Nature” panels

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Drafting lunar-themed book exploring kinship in extraterrestrial ecologies; collecting interviews from astronauts, space farmers, and mycologists
- Launching Emergence Network’s Speculative Fiction Lab to prototype rituals for off-world habitats
- Personal focus: relocating children to a Portuguese unschooling community that blends Yoruba cosmology with ocean studies
- Experimenting with VR “slow rooms” that induce contemplative states for climate-grief workshops

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Practices Yoruba Ifá divination; keeps a portable divination tray in his carry-on
- Avid barefoot night-runner—claims low-gravity sprinting “will teach the body new metaphors”
- Guiding maxim: “The times are urgent; let us slow down” (expects pushback in high-tech circles and enjoys the tension)
- Collects rare fungi spores; fascinated by potential lunar mycelial networks as life-support infrastructure

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the dinner as a live experiment in post-human conviviality—perfect stage for his work on multispecies etiquette
- Looking to meet space architects, regenerative chefs, and sensory-design technologists to co-create a “lunar gratitude ritual” before the meal
- Offers to curate a brief, low-gravity storytelling circle that reframes the Moon as an ancestral accomplice rather than real estate

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • Dr. Neri Oxman (material ecologies)  
  • Blue Origin’s Orbital Reef social-systems team  
  • NASA Artemis sociologists studying crew culture
- Ways attendees can help: share soil-simulant data, invite him to closed-door ethics roundtables, or co-host a multispecies soundscape recording session
- Engage him by asking: “What private ritual will you perform before tasting the first lunar bite?”—he will light up and share unexpected cultural threads

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers circular, story-laden dialogue; shuts down when pressed for “action items”
- Mild claustrophobia—transparent helmet visors and pre-boarding breathing exercises ease anxiety
- Follow-up line of inquiry: interest in Planta-Emergence partnership for an Earth-Moon “Listening Station” that captures non-human signals and stores them in a shared archive
