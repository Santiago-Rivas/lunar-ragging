### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Grace Hopper

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Maintained as a high-fidelity “digital twin” stewarded by the Hopper Legacy Trust; principal servers housed at the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA
- Physical presence managed through advanced telepresence rigs; regularly “travels” to D.C., London, and Tokyo for policy briefings and STEM events

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Pioneering computer scientist; U.S. Navy Rear Admiral (ret.); originator of COBOL and advocate of machine-independent programming
- Namesake of the annual Grace Hopper Celebration (45,000+ attendees) and multiple naval vessels & academic chairs
- Current influence: consults on long-duration space-mission software reliability, serves on NASA Artemis Digital Heritage Board

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Spearheading “Zero-Bug Horizon,” a cross-agency initiative to harden life-critical code for lunar habitats and Mars transits
- Advising the IEEE working group on quantum–classical interoperability standards
- Personal ambition: ensure her historical archives—including 1950s logbooks—are migrated to tamper-proof lunar cold-storage vaults by 2028

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong advocate of plain-English coding; still touts her maxim, “Humans should program in language humans can read.”
- Collects antique timepieces; fascinated by relativistic time drift between Earth and cislunar orbit
- Keeps a jar of physical nanosecond-length wires on her desk replica and loves using them as an icebreaker about latency

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: symbolically links the dawn of electronic computing with humanity’s next frontier of off-planet social computing
- Eager to test Planta’s immersive social platform for latency-compensated collaboration; will provide blunt feedback on UI clarity
- Seeks dialogue on embedding ethical debugging rituals into the culture of early lunar communities
- Can demo a prototype “COBOL-to-LunarOps” transpiler built with Naval Academy cadets—fun, nostalgic crowd-pleaser

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: SpaceX Starlink Edge team (for deterministic networking), International Lunar Research Station consortium leads, and food-tech startups exploring closed-loop agronomy code
- Offers crisp mentorship to younger attendees on software discipline and version-control hygiene in constrained environments
- Ideal engagement: invite her to co-storyboard a 90-second “bug hunt” scenario specific to lunar life-support systems during dessert

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers conversations that jump straight to concrete challenges; dislikes abstract futurism without executable plans
- Sensitive topic: preserving historical context—she reacts coolly when her early work is commercialized without acknowledgment
- Good follow-up question: “Which overlooked wartime code-breaking practice should we resurrect for spaceflight reliability?”
