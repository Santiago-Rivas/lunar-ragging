### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • ESA’s Bio-Regenerative Life Support team (for shared protocols)  
  • SpaceX Raptor reuse program managers (life-cycle LCA data)  
  • Faith-based philanthropic funds exploring “Creation Care” in space  
- Ways attendees can help: Share prototypes or datasets on in-situ resource utilization; discuss art-science collaborations for her upcoming book  
- Engagement tips: Lead with mission purpose over technology specs; reserve 2 minutes for her to pose a probing question—she values reciprocal curiosity

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Devout Christian; appreciates when climate framing includes moral language of “loving our neighbor” rather than partisan cues
