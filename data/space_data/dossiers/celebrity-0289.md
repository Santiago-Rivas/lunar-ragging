### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Larry Page

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Palo Alto, CA  
- Secondary residence: Tē Pāmu, a private eco-compound on Fiji’s Laucala Island; uses it as a low-profile R&D retreat  
- Regular circuits: Mountain View → Southern New Zealand test strips (electric air-taxi flights) → Austin for geothermal spin-out meetings  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder, Google; Board Member & special-projects sponsor, Alphabet Inc.  
- Quiet force behind X’s “Mineral” ag-tech unit and the new Quantum-AI Integration Program (“QuAIP”)  
- Major backer of Wisk Aero (eVTOL autonomy) and Calico Labs (human-longevity therapeutics)  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Pushing Wisk to secure FAA type certification before 2026 Los Angeles Games; exploring lunar-surface mobility as next proving ground  
- Funding a stealth geothermal venture—aims to power remote data centers, including potential lunar comms arrays  
- Personal goal: master conversational Japanese by year-end to build deeper ties with Toyota-aligned aerospace partners  
- Allocating personal capital to radical life-support research (closed-loop microbiomes) applicable to off-Earth habitation  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Wind-surfing & foil-boarding on open ocean; believes the sport sharpens systems-level thinking  
- Restores vintage mechanical calculators; keeps a 1936 Marchant on his Fiji desk—claims it inspires “algorithmic humility”  
- Guiding maxim: “Simplicity scales; complexity ossifies.”  
- Enjoys unexpected dinner-table engineering puzzles—expects hosts to “ask harder questions than a 5-year-old would”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a stress-test for social UX in low-gravity—keen to observe how tactile and auditory cues shift human collaboration  
- Wants introductions to chefs experimenting with closed-loop agricultural inputs (micro-greens grown under LED spectra)  
- Can contribute expertise in ultra-low-latency optical comms and autonomous logistics for lunar resupply  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA’s OPS-NET architecture team; ESA’s MELiSSA bioregenerative life-support lead; SoftBank’s HAPS program director  
- Attendees can help by sharing failure logs from crewed isolation studies—he’s compiling a cross-domain error taxonomy  
- Engage him with concise, data-rich prompts; segue into Montessori-style curiosity questions for memorable exchange  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers settings where phones are out of sight; expects Chatham House discretion  
- Surprising tidbit for the conversation prompt: he secretly composes minimalist piano études and passed Grade 8 theory last summer—rarely disclosed beyond family  
- Future follow-up: gauge interest in co-funding Planta’s “Mixed Reality Empathy Lab” slated for 2028 Mars analog habitat
