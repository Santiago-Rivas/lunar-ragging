### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jacob Collier

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: North London studio home (“The Barn”)
- Regular long-haul loops: Los Angeles (spatial-audio sessions), Boston/New York (Berklee & label), Tokyo (fan-base cultivation)
- Routinely books one-month “deep-work residencies” in secluded settings to write/arrange without outside noise

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Independent artist-producer; 5× Grammy-winning multi-instrumentalist celebrated for hyper-dense harmony and real-time looping
- Founder, Mitre Studios: boutique production house for immersive concerts, Dolby Atmos mixes, and music-education content
- Visiting creative fellow, MIT Media Lab (Musical AI group) – co-developing adaptive harmony algorithms for live use

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Final mastering of “Djesse Vol. 4” (release Sept 2025) with cameo choir recorded on three continents
- Building a modular touring rig optimized for carbon-neutral freight; investigating lightweight graphene speaker arrays
- Negotiating a film-score debut for an untitled Ridley Scott sci-fi project (2026 slate)
- Personal ambition: write a book translating advanced harmony concepts into color theory and geometry for broader audiences

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Off-hours obsession: mechanical puzzle design; owns 40+ custom twisty cubes he solves to trigger creative breakthroughs
- Collects field recordings of “unusual resonant spaces” (abandoned satellites, underground cisterns); treats them as harmonic palettes
- Guiding philosophy: “Curiosity plus play equals infinity”—encourages perpetual beginner’s mindset
- Uncommon fact worth sharing when prompted: once rigged a unicycle-powered calliope to sequence 12-tone counterpoint for street performance

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: pioneer of multi-dimensional sound—ideal voice on how lunar acoustics can reshape social experiences
- Seeking: collaborators with expertise in low-gravity fluid dynamics to prototype water-based percussion sculptures for a Moon-shot performance art piece
- Will contribute: impromptu polyphonic vocal layering that leverages the base’s domed architecture to demonstrate harmonic interference patterns

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • NASA acoustics team (for reverberation modelling)  
  • SpaceX Starship cargo planners (to test mini-studio payload)  
  • Michelin-level culinary chemists exploring sonification of taste
- Ways attendees can help: share sensor data on lunar ambient noise; advise on patent strategy for adaptive harmony AI module
- Engaging tactics: ask him to improvise using ambient tableware sounds; propose co-creating a “Moon chord” derived from SELENE seismic readings

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: intensely protects creative control—avoid implying label ownership; approach ventures as joint creative labs
- Prefers first-meeting conversations that jump straight into “impossible” ideas; small talk drains energy
- Follow-up areas: confirm visa/logistics for 2027 Moon trip; clarify whether custom-built Harmoniser hardware requires radiation-shielded casing
