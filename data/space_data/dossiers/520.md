### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Samaira Mehta

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Santa Clara, CA (family residence + CoderBunnyz HQ)
- Regular circuits: Bay Area investor events, national STEM-education conferences, annual India outreach tour (Delhi, Bengaluru) every December

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, CoderBunnyz, CoderMindz, and CoderMarblez—board-game franchises teaching coding, AI, and algorithms to K-12
- Launched “Yes, One Billion Kids Can Code” campaign; >150,000 students reached across 43 countries
- Youngest speaker to headline a Microsoft Ignite keynote; featured by TIME, CNBC, and Forbes 30-Under-30 (Education, 2024)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Converting flagship board games into a mixed-reality platform that runs equally well on Earth-orbit latency (demo in Q3 2026 with Starlink EDU)
- Building a scholarship fund for under-connected girls in sub-Saharan Africa—target: 10,000 laptops shipped by mid-2027
- Finalizing freshman-year deferral at Stanford CS (adm. Fall 2025) to focus on Series A raise for CoderBunnyz Digital ($12 M target, half committed)
- Personally fascinated by generative-AI-for-music; experimenting with algorithmic lo-fi tracks to embed in learning modules

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Competitive chess player; uses end-game puzzles to teach recursion concepts
- Weekend surf sessions in Santa Cruz—claims “debugging feels like paddling out; repetitive but zen”
- Guiding mantra: “If kids can play, they can build the future.”
- Big fan of Robert A. Heinlein’s lunar novels—sees space settlements as the ultimate STEM classroom

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending as youth-innovation showcase guest; will bring a prototype “CoderLunaz,” a magnetic-tile coding game engineered for micro-gravity
- Seeks dialogue on: latency-tolerant multiplayer design, lunar-based education research, and carbon-neutral packaging for off-planet logistics
- Value offered: high-energy storytelling that resonates with media; can run an on-site 15-minute coding mini-camp for VIPs’ children via holoscreens

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: NASA Office of STEM Engagement, Blue Origin’s Club for the Future, SoftBank Vision Fund’s edtech desk
- Mutual wins: pair her with chefs crafting the dinner menu—she wants to integrate edible QR codes linking to lunar science lessons
- Engage her by asking about the “one algorithm she would trust to run a moon base” or inviting her to co-host a quick-fire ideation game during dessert

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers conversational prompts over direct praise; disengages when pigeonholed as a “kid genius”
- Flying in with parents (required chaperones until 18th birthday on Feb 26 2025); confirm accommodation includes reliable uplink for live workshop stream
- Follow-up intel to gather: status of trademark filing for CoderLunaz, and whether she wants post-event press coordinated jointly with Planta’s comms team
