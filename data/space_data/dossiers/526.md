### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Sonam Wangchuk

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Phyang village, Leh-Ladakh, India (alt. 3,500 m); uses a self-built passive-solar earth home as HQ  
- Regular travel loop: Delhi → Zürich → Stockholm for climate forums; seasonal field trips across the Himalayan belt and to Bhutan/Nepal test sites  
- Habitually schedules long layovers in Abu Dhabi to court Gulf philanthropy for desert-water projects  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Himalayan Institute of Alternatives–Ladakh (HIAL) — an applied R&D university for mountain ecosystems, slated for full accreditation by 2026  
- Technical Lead, “Ice Stupa” artificial glacier program (52 sites, 7 countries)  
- 2018 Ramon Magsaysay Laureate; UN “Earth Champion” 2024; patent holder on high-efficiency solar mud-brick insulation  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Completing HIAL’s net-negative-carbon campus powered by hybrid solar-hydrogen micro-grid before winter 2026  
- Scaling modular “Ice Stupa 2.0” kits for Central Asian dry valleys; targeting 1,000 installations by 2028  
- Prototyping minimalist life-support architectures for extreme environments (Mars Desert Research Station collaboration kicks off Q3 2025)  
- Personal ambition: document indigenous Himalayan engineering in a bilingual children’s graphic novel series (first volume in press)  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobbies: nocturnal astrophotography with homemade tracking rigs; can whistle distinct Ladakhi ibex calls (crowd-pleaser)  
- Philosophical anchor: “Nature is the best engineer—copy her, don’t conquer her.” Often cites ancient Ladakhi proverb, “The roof is as alive as the roots.”  
- Practices one-minute micro-meditations before critical meetings; offers to teach the method on request  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: expertise in closed-loop water and thermal systems for resource-scarce habitats directly informs sustainable lunar living concepts  
- Seeks dialogue on integrating regolith-based 3D printing with passive solar design to cut launch-mass of future lunar habitats by 30 %  
- Hopes to recruit space-tech partners for a joint Earth–Moon “Extreme Habitat Innovation Challenge” aimed at students from remote regions  
- Will contribute a live demo of compact sublimation-based water harvesting (fits a carry-on cube) for the dinner showcase  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • ESA life-support architecture team (crossover funding lines)  
  • Patagonia’s “Home Planet Fund” for climate-space synergy grants  
  • Chef-scientists exploring zero-waste food cycles (tie-in with HIAL’s algae-protein work)  
- Ideal engagement: walk-through of the lunar base’s heat management layout; he loves on-site tinkering and rapid feedback sessions  
- Offer attendees a 48-hour Ladakh field visit (post-event) to test tech at 5,000 m—strong incentive for adventurous investors  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Dietary: strict vegetarian, zero alcohol; appreciates fresh herbs—peppermint especially  
- Sensitive area: currently vocal on Ladakh’s fragile politics; steer conversation toward environmental stewardship, not governance  
- Follow-up questions: status of his planned “Glacier Bond” green finance instrument; interest level in co-authoring a white paper on lunar-Himalayan knowledge transfer
