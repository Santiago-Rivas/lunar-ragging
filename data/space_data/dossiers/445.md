### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Feng Zhang

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Cambridge, Massachusetts (Broad & McGovern Institutes)
- Secondary footholds: San Francisco (investor meetings) and Singapore (SynBio hub he quietly seeded at A*STAR)
- Rhythmic travel: Quarterly Beijing trips to cultivate China–US translational pipelines; annual winter retreat in rural Iowa to visit family and reset

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Core roles: Investigator, Broad Institute; Professor of Neuroscience, MIT; HHMI Scholar
- Founding scientist: Editas Medicine, Beam Therapeutics, Arbor Biotechnologies, Sherlock Biosciences
- Influence points:
  • Co-pioneer of CRISPR-Cas9 and Cas12 editing platforms  
  • Led SHERLOCK CRISPR diagnostics adopted by 30+ national labs  
  • Holder of 90+ patents; litigation-tempered but still aggressive on IP defense

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling a next-gen programmable RNA editor (FERN) aimed at transient therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders—first human dosing slated for late 2026
- Building a “Microgravity CRISPR Toolkit” with NASA Ames to study DNA repair pathways under lunar radiation
- Personal six-month sprint: mastering Mandarin scientific jargon to bridge regulatory approvals for cross-border gene therapy trials
- Quiet passion project: developing an open-source bio-surveillance platform for pandemic early-warning, funded through his new philanthropic arm, Helix Horizon

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobbies: Vintage mechanical keyboards (curates a 40-piece collection); night-sky astrophotography—believes “seeing photons that left a star 200 years ago is the best reminder of scientific humility”
- Philosophies: “Biology is software; evolution is the original open-source license”
- Surprising quirk: Plays improv jazz piano to decompress—records one take every Sunday at 2 a.m.

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: His lunar CRISPR toolkit aligns directly with Planta’s vision of sustaining human life off-Earth
- Seeking: Partners with closed-loop life-support expertise and culinary scientists exploring engineered microbes for on-base food production
- Offers: Can provide rapid prototyping of stress-tolerant plant genomes; willing to host joint press brief on “editing for extraterrestrial resilience”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • SpaceX Starship payload integration lead  
  • Alain Ducasse’s R&D chef team (fermentation focus)  
  • Global Health Investment Corp. for equity-philanthropy blend
- Ways to help: Arrange micro-grant pitches with impact investors; facilitate small-group dinner (Earth-side) with artists to craft CRISPR storytelling
- Engagement tip: Start with music or photography, then pivot to bio-astro topics; avoid opening with patent disputes, he tunes out

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Internal debate at Broad over dual-use biosecurity guidelines—he appreciates candid but informed discussion, not alarmism
- Follow-up questions:  
  • Status of his lunar radiation-shielded tissue bioreactor prototype  
  • How he envisions CRISPR ethics oversight when experimentation happens off-planet
