### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Ian Goodfellow

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Mountain View, CA
- Rotates between Tokyo, Paris, and Toronto to coordinate multi-site generative-AI labs
- Known for “48-hour strike missions” — drops into partner facilities for rapid prototyping sprints, then vanishes before week’s end

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- VP of Research & Head of Generative Models, Google DeepMind (since 2024)
- Inventor of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs); Turing Award shortlist 2026 buzz
- Co-author of the canonical textbook “Deep Learning,” now in its 3rd edition with multimodal and safety chapters

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Steering Project Kaleidoscope: next-gen multimodal model optimized for on-device inference with <5 W power draw (ties to lunar habitat edge-compute constraints)
- Finalizing a multilateral open-weight standard for safe content generation; lobbying IEEE for adoption
- Personally learning orbital mechanics through Georgia Tech’s online Aerospace MS to “design AI that understands space as natively as Earth”
- Six-month wellness experiment: total digital-free Sundays, tracking cognitive recovery for publication in JAMA Netw. Open

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Recreational rock climber; claims climbing hones his intuition for high-dimensional optimization
- Collects mid-century science-fiction zines—uses plot devices to stress-test alignment scenarios
- Guiding maxim: “Adversarial tension breeds creativity—so long as the rules are explicit”
- Surprising tidbit: can perform close-up sleight-of-hand; uses card tricks to teach gradient descent concepts to interns

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a live sandbox for human-AI co-presence in extreme environments
- Wants candid feedback on low-latency generative avatars that fill awkward communication gaps during six-second Earth-Moon lag
- Interested in meeting materials scientists exploring self-healing polymers for lightweight GPU housings under lunar radiation

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Dr. Chiara Rossi (ESA Life-Support Robotics)  
  • Alex Chen (Lux Capital’s new Off-World Systems Fund)  
  • Chef-chemist Virgil Tan (pioneering edible biosensors)
- Offers: 30-day access to DeepMind’s edge-model sandbox for any attendee proposing a moon-relevant use case
- Engagement tip: open with an unexpected technical constraint; he’ll instinctively brainstorm architectures on a napkin

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Politely intolerant of vague futurism; anchor conversations in tractable metrics
- Prefers sparkling water over alcohol; hypnotic fascination with uncommon flavors (yuzu-pepper, smoked plum)
- Follow-up question: “If you could make one aspect of lunar life feel emotionally ‘Earth-like,’ what would you choose and why?”
