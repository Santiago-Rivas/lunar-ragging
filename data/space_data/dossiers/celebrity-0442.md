### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Emmanuelle Charpentier

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Berlin, Germany (Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens)  
- Maintains studios/flats in Paris & Boston; in‐person every 6–8 weeks for board meetings and academic lecturing  
- Regularly routes travel through Stockholm and Singapore—“triangle routine” keeps her within 6 hrs of any key lab partner

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-inventor of CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing; Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2020  
- Founder & Scientific Director, Max Planck Spin-out “PathoCRISPR” (antimicrobial gene therapies; Series A €95 M, 2024)  
- Board/advisor: CRISPR Therapeutics, Airbus Defense Bio-Module program, EU High-Level Group on Biosecurity  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Fast-tracking CRISPR-based antimicrobials for hospital superbugs; Phase I data expected Q4 2025  
- Building a GMP “green lab” in Brandenburg powered 80 % by on-site solar/hydrogen, pioneering low-carbon wet-lab processes  
- Drafting policy brief on genomic safeguards for closed-loop space habitats (commissioned by ESA & European Parliament)  
- Personal: finishing private pilot license—wants to co-pilot a suborbital flight by 2026; composing cello/piano duet inspired by bacterial quorum sensing for Expo 2027  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Recharges through alpine climbing; summited Matterhorn via Hörnli Ridge last summer  
- Collects vintage fountain pens—writes all lab notes with a 1947 Aurora 88  
- Guiding maxim: “Rigor breeds audacity; audacity breeds discovery.”  
- Little-known fact she enjoys sharing: drummed in a Parisian punk band during med-school (“loud, fast, precise—like CRISPR”).  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar base food safety requires sterile, genetically stable microbes—her latest CRISPR kill-switch tech is tailor-made for this  
- Actively seeking (1) microgravity payload slots to test pathogen behavior, (2) early adopters of low-energy bioreactors for off-Earth habitats  
- Ready to host a 10-minute “genome-edited sourdough” tasting to spark discussion on ethical biotech cuisine  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable intros: SpaceX life-support team, Axiom Station’s CMO, Global Food Futures Fund, chef-scientist José Andrés (for culinary genome collab)  
- Attendees could provide lunar-grade materials data for bioreactor housing or connect her with carbon-neutral logistics partners  
- Best engagement tactics: offer concrete use cases (microbial bioplastics, space-gardening), reference punk music or mountaineering to break the ice, keep jargon minimal but data precise  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: navigating France–Germany IP tension over upcoming CRISPR patents—avoid probing on the legal strategy tonight  
- Dietary: allergic to shellfish; appreciates plant-based haute cuisine  
- Follow-up question for future call: timeline and funding gap for the proposed “Lunar Microbial Vault” (est. €30 M)
