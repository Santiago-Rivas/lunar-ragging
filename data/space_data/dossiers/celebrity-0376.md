### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Arvind Krishna

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Armonk, NY; maintains apartment in mid-Manhattan for late-night research sessions
- Quarterly rotation through Bangalore, Tel Aviv, and Zurich research labs; added Houston visits to shadow NASA’s Artemis teams
- Known for boarding the first flight out, returning same day—“sleep is an optimization problem” mindset

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chairman & CEO, IBM (since 2020); architect of $34 B Red Hat deal and post-merger hybrid-cloud dominance
- Spearheaded IBM Quantum program; 350+ client pilots, first 127-qubit commercial system on-track for 2025
- Key influence: global policy voice on AI governance—co-authored 2024 G7 “Responsible Frontier Model” framework

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Driving watsonx Gen-AI adoption inside heavy-regulated sectors; target: $10 B annual run-rate by Q4 2026
- Standing up “Edge-to-Orbit” offering—containerized AI/analytics stack hardened for micro-gravity and lunar latency
- Scouting acquisition in secure satellite networking to future-proof IBM against quantum-enabled attacks
- Personal: mentoring his daughter’s robotics team; pushing to double IBM’s free quantum computing hours for student projects worldwide

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate amateur astrophotographer—carries a mirrorless rig to capture night skies during business trips; claims coding shaders improves his image stacking
- Grew up playing tabla; still practices rhythmic cycles (tala) to unwind before major negotiations
- Guiding maxim: “Technology should compress distance—physical, economic, or cognitive”
- Surprisingly curious about molecular gastronomy; enjoys debating the “computational” nature of flavor with chefs

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Views the lunar dinner as a live testbed for IBM’s Edge-to-Orbit stack; keen to benchmark latency between Sea of Tranquility and Earth cloud regions
- Wants candid dialogue on psychological aspects of prolonged off-world collaboration—feeding into IBM Research’s “Human Factors in Hybrid Work 2030” study
- Brings deep enterprise relationships (Fortune 100) and can amplify Planta’s lunar-as-a-platform narrative to global CIOs

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros sought to: SpaceX Starlink LEO networking team, JAXA lunar comms director, and venture arms of Airbus & Lockheed for joint R&D credits
- Happy to advise early-stage founders on quantum-safe encryption or regulated-industry go-to-market
- Engage him with a pointed data question (e.g., “How would you architect zero-trust on the far side of the Moon?”) followed by a personal curveball about tabla rhythms—he’ll stay past his next meeting

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers precision: quote metrics, not metaphors; yet enjoys one wildcard question (“What’s the strangest sky you’ve photographed?”)
- Sensitive topic: workforce automation layoffs—steer toward upskilling narratives instead
- Follow-up question worth exploring: his internal deadline for quantum advantage benchmarks and how third-party partners can plug into that timeline
