### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Liu Zihong

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Shenzhen & Hong Kong; “working retreats” every 6–8 weeks in Palo Alto
- Routinely schedules Asia-US red-eye hops to maximize overlap with global partners; keeps a collapsible VR headset in carry-on to simulate factory floors while in transit

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Executive Chairman, Royole Corporation—pioneer in ultra-thin flexible displays and sensors
- Holds 400+ patents; Forbes “Top 10 Chinese Innovators Under 40”; produced world’s first rollable smartphone and full-flex car interior demo

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Repositioning Royole as a B2B platform, licensing bendable OLED stacks to aerospace, wearables, and luxury interiors
- Closing a $180 M strategic round led by a Middle-East sovereign fund to bankroll a next-gen fab in Abu Dhabi
- Personally overseeing a moon-grade display laminate that survives −170 °C to +120 °C thermal swings—wants flight qualification by Q4 2026
- Exploring “digital origami” art installations that merge e-paper, haptics, and generative AI for immersive storytelling
- Private ambition: complete a 10-day silent meditation retreat after funding milestones—believes stillness accelerates design insight

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Practiced Wing Chun since university; credits stance training for tabletop-level focus during negotiations
- Collects late-Qing dynasty inkstones; sketches flexible circuit patterns on rice paper for relaxation
- Guiding maxim: “曲则全—flex to endure,” frequently quotes this when pitching flexible tech’s future ubiquity
- Surprising fact (conversation seed): once played lead guitar in a campus heavy-metal band, still riffs at 3 a.m. after product launches

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar venue aligns with his drive to prove flex-electronics viable in extreme environments; eager to discuss in-situ production using regolith-derived substrates
- Seeking dialogue with habitat designers about integrating transparent, roll-down displays into observation domes for real-time Earth-Moon data visualization
- Can contribute portable, unbreakable display panels for live art installations during dinner—zero-risk of shattering in 1/6 g

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: SpaceX Starship materials team; Axiom Space habitat architects; Sony Pictures Immersive for cross-reality storytelling
- Open to co-funding student-led lunar experiments featuring flexible sensors; offers factory time and mentorship
- Best engagement: invite opinion on how “soft tech” changes hard environments—he loves white-board napkin sketches over dessert

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid rehashing Royole’s delayed 2021 IPO; frame questions around future resilience, not past liquidity crunch
- Prefers concise stats first, philosophy second; will disengage if conversation feels purely speculative
- Potential follow-up: ask whether his moon-grade laminate can incorporate photovoltaic layers—could unlock joint patent work
