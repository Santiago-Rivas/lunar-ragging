### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Sam Altman

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: San Francisco; maintains pied-à-terre in New York for policy work  
- 60–70% of time in transit—regular loops through Washington DC (regulation), Abu Dhabi & Tokyo (compute financing), and Lausanne (fusion R&D)  
- Keeps an unpublicized retreat outside Big Sur for “thinking weekends” with a tight founder circle  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- CEO & Co-Founder, OpenAI; stewarding the GPT-6/“Omni” training run (target: 2-trillion-param scale)  
- Chairman, Tools for Humanity (Worldcoin); 236 M verified IDs as of Q2 2025  
- Early investor/advisor: Helion Energy (fusion), Retro Biosciences (longevity), Humane (wearables)  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Securing sovereign-level commitments for global AI compute grid (“Compute as a public good” pitch)  
- Negotiating long-term uranium & rare-earth supply for fusion-powered data centers  
- Standing up OpenAI’s “Alignment Superlab” in Basel—200-person multidisciplinary team  
- Personal: diving into DAO-governed space settlement models; collecting data for a forthcoming essay series “Fragments of a Lunar Republic”  
- 12-month ambition: prove that AI-guided bioreactors can halve protein costs—pathway to closed-loop off-world diets  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobbies: high-altitude glider pilot, vintage topographic map collector, competitive poker (online alias routinely ranks top-50)  
- Core belief: “Progress compounds when risk tolerance and moral imagination scale together.”  
- Surprising quirk: programs one weekend a quarter with no internet—writes code on air-gapped laptops, then destroys the drives  
- Favorite ice-breaker question: “What’s the most important problem nobody assigns any prestige to?”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to Planta’s moon dinner as a real-world testbed for human–AI co-designed social rituals in extreme environments  
- Looking to swap notes on: autonomous greenhouse ops, psychological resilience of small crews, identity verification off-planet (Worldcoin-style orbiters)  
- Offers: seamless conversational AI layer for guests, predictive logistics models for lunar supply chains, investor signal boost via his 12 M-subscriber tech letter  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • Dr. Jessica Hwang (NASA ISRU lead) for regolith-based construction AI models  
  • Sovereign Wealth Fund of Singapore—potential anchor for Compute Grid round  
- Attendees can help by sharing data from analog habitat experiments & gourmet shelf-stable food tech  
- Engage him with contrarian proposals; he disengages quickly from incremental pitches  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: keeps a tight rein on personal security—no photos without consent, prefers first-name basis  
- Avoid dystopian rhetoric; he’s fatigued by “AI doom” framing—prefers constructive alignment talk  
- Follow-up questions: status of his closed-loop protein pilot in Oakland; interest in on-site live demo of Planta’s emotion-mapping engine for AI social graphs
