### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Brad Smith

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Seattle, WA  
- Maintains apartments in Washington, DC (policy) and Brussels (EU engagement)  
- Flight pattern: Weekly SEA–IAD shuttle; quarterly circuits through London–Berlin–Geneva; newly added visits to Houston & Cape Canaveral for space-industry briefings  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- President & Vice Chair, Microsoft (board seat since 2021)  
- Oversees global policy, legal affairs, and sovereign-cloud partnerships—$70 B+ in annual contracts tied to his org  
- Architect of the “AI for Governance” framework adopted by 40+ nations; key negotiator behind the EU–US Cloud Accord (2024)  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Building a secure “off-planet edge” platform enabling latency-tolerant AI workloads for lunar and Mars missions (joint study with NASA + JAXA)  
- Finalizing 2030 Carbon-Negative roadmap—pivoting from offsets to direct air capture plants in the Pacific Northwest  
- Personal mandate: embed human-rights impact assessments into every Azure AI service before general release  
- Preparing a policy memoir (“Rails Before Rockets”) slated for late 2026; seeking fresh anecdotes from frontier environments  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Grew up on a Wisconsin dairy farm—still rises at 4 a.m. to run six miles; attributes discipline to “chores in -20°F before school”  
- Fluent in French; uses it to read de Tocqueville in original text  
- Amateur pianist: favors Chopin nocturnes, travels with a folding digital keyboard  
- Guiding maxim: “Technology moves at the speed of trust, not code.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to validate Planta Network’s lunar data-sovereignty model and discuss governance lessons from terrestrial clouds  
- Actively scouting partners for radiation-hardened AI accelerators and autonomous maintenance bots  
- Will share Microsoft’s closed-loop water-recycling advances—applicable to lunar habitats  
- Curious about the cultural dimension: how shared meals influence crew cohesion in extreme environments  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros valued:  
  • Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) leads at NASA  
  • UX designers focused on neuroadaptive interfaces (for zero-G workstations)  
  • Chief Corporate Affairs officers from non-US space agencies to widen multilateral trust network  
- Offer: pro-bono legal blueprint for cross-border data transfers between Earth and cis-lunar orbit, aligned with ISO 59000  
- Engaging tactic: ask how his dairy-farm upbringing informs space-colony ethics—rarely discussed yet energizes him  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Steers clear of partisan chatter; prefers framing issues as “global commons.”  
- Be mindful: his calendar is precise to the minute; late starts frustrate him.  
- Follow-up probes: status of the off-planet edge platform pilot and whether Microsoft will open-source its lunar latency simulator.
