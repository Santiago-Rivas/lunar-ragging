### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Robert Downey Jr.

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Malibu, CA; secondary apartment in Manhattan for studio meetings
- Regular circuits: London–Atlanta (Marvel reshoots), Austin (FootPrint Coalition HQ), Davos (annual WEF climate sessions)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Actor-producer, most globally recognized as “Iron Man” (highest-grossing solo franchise to date)
- Founder, FootPrint Coalition – early-stage fund + media platform backing climate-tech startups ($300 M deployed across 40 companies)
- Executive Producer on Max docuseries “The Age of A.I.” and upcoming Apple TV+ alt-history space drama

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing FootPrint Coalition Fund II ($750 M) with heavier exposure to closed-loop materials, orbital debris remediation, and bio-engineered foods
- Negotiating final script notes and distribution strategy for “Sherlock Holmes 3” (2026 release target)
- Personal mission: leverage celebrity reach to accelerate consumer adoption of sustainable tech; experimenting with interactive storytelling in VR/AR to “make climate cool”
- Family focus: preparing son Exton for first high-school year; seeks assignments that keep him stateside through mid-2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Daily Wing Chun practice—uses martial-arts metaphors when discussing breakthrough thinking
- Keeps 2.5 million bees across three California apiaries; claims beekeeping “rewired” his attention span
- Loves classic muscle-car restoration but recently converted a 1970 Chevelle to full electric drivetrain
- Favorite maxim: “Momentum equals freedom” (often quotes his late mentor Anthony Hopkins)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Moon dinner as it intersects celebrity storytelling, futurist tech, and sustainable habitats
- Searching for lunar agriculture demos and regenerative life-support systems relevant to FootPrint’s “off-world resilience” thesis
- Plans to film a micro-documentary segment—granting Planta exclusive behind-the-scenes if alignment on messaging
- Likely to ask guests, “What’s the moonshot hobby that nobody knows you’re obsessed with?”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros requested: 
  • Space-ag pioneer Sana Gupta (Regolith Farms)  
  • Axiom Station’s public-engagement lead  
  • Culinary chemist José Andrés for zero-waste food labs
- Offers in return: media amplification (150 M social reach), cameo appearances, or advisory board seats for climate-adjacent startups
- Engage him with tangible prototypes; he dislikes slide decks—prefers to “taste, touch, and hack”

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Strictly alcohol-free; provide zero-proof haute-cocktails
- Time-bounded: prefers 20-min meetings, early morning or post-event wind-down
- Curious follow-up: gauge his interest in narrating Planta’s post-mission docu-short; confirm availability Feb–Mar 2027
