### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Iddris Sandu

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Angeles, CA; maintains satellite studio in Accra, Ghana for talent pipelines
- Spends 35–40% of the year on the road—Bay Area for chip supply partners, New York fashion weeks, occasional Dubai stopovers for sovereign-fund talks

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Spatial Labs (SLabs) – developing “LNQ One” chip-enabled apparel that links physical goods to digital twins on-chain
- Former tech consultant to Uber, Snapchat, and Apple retail innovation teams
- Forbes “30 Under 30,” recipient of the inaugural Virgil Abloh Design Fellowship

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a $50 M Series B with strategic aerospace and luxury-goods investors to extend LNQ protocol to off-planet commerce
- Piloting “Terraform OS,” a spatial-computing layer that syncs wearables with real-time geospatial data—moon-surface mapping is a live test case
- Personally studying orbital mechanics and astrobotany to inform product narratives around “clothing that knows where it is in the universe”
- Ambition: build a Ghana-based fab within 18 months to localize semiconductor packaging and prove an Africa-to-space supply chain

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects 1960s NASA mission patches; uses them as design prompts
- Plays kora (West African lute) to decompress—believes “traditional strings balance digital noise”
- Mantra: “Context is the new commodity”—sees location-aware data as the next trillion-dollar canvas
- Surprising fact to surface: wrote experimental poetry in Twi that won a regional prize at age 12—rarely publicized

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending to showcase how LNQ chips retain authentication even in low-gravity, radiation-rich environments—first live demo outside Earth
- Seeking dialogue on lunar materials science (dust abrasion on sensors) and sovereign data policies for extraterrestrial domains
- Offers value: can rapidly prototype immersive retail experiences aboard the base, turning the dinner into a case study for “spatial commerce beyond Earth”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA’s Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative, ESA materials lab, LVMH’s Chief Innovation Officer
- Helpful asks: test data from ISRU (in-situ resource utilization) experiments; design partners for limited-edition “Moon-Birthed” apparel drop
- Engage him by sketching ideas on a tablet—visual co-creation energizes him; steer clear of long PowerPoint decks

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: very protective of IP—expects airtight NDAs before deep dives
- Avoid mention of brief, tense split with Ye’s venture arm; topic fatigues him
- Follow-up areas: availability of lunar spectrum bandwidth for real-time blockchain validation; potential student fellowship connecting Caltech, KNUST, and SLabs for off-planet design challenges
