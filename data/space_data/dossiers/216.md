### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling “A-Z Performance Lab” – a data-driven youth academy using spatial computing and AI biometrics
- Negotiating docu-series with Apple TV+ chronicling athlete adaptation to microgravity training
- Personal agenda: attain sub-orbital pilot license by late 2026; leverage lunar trip to launch charitable STEM challenge for underserved kids in Scandinavia and MENA

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Off-pitch passions: taekwondo (black belt), vintage muscle cars, nocturnal astrophotography from the Swedish archipelago
- Reads Stoic philosophy; favorite line to teammates: “He who fears death never truly lives.”
- Enjoys surprising people with his baking skills—specialty is saffron buns learned from his Bosniak mother
- Believes space tourism will create “the ultimate away game” mentality for human collaboration

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Draw: magnetic storyteller with 120 M social followers—ideal for amplifying Planta’s lunar narrative
- Discussion targets: human peak performance in low-gravity, integrating sports kinetics into social VR, and culinary rituals that bond diverse crews in isolated environments
- Value add: willing to host a live-stream “gravity challenge” with fellow guests, providing viral content and real-time physiological data for Planta R&D

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros sought to: SpaceX Starship life-support leads, Michelin chef Hélène Darroze (to co-design Swedish-French fusion lunar menu), and Web3 loyal-fan token funds
- Attendees can assist by offering: insights on mental resilience in extreme environments, licensing pathways for space-shot content, or co-investments in VR training pods
- Engagement tip: open with a playful dare—e.g., “Can you strike a bicycle-kick in one-sixth gravity?” He responds enthusiastically to challenges that test alpha prowess

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
