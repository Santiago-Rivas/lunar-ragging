### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Kate Crawford

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Split between New York City (AI Now Institute HQ) and Los Angeles (USC Annenberg School)
- Regular circuits: Brussels & Geneva for policy forums; Sydney for family and field research in the Pilbara mines

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Research Professor, USC Annenberg; Co-founder, AI Now Institute; Senior Principal Researcher, Microsoft Research
- Author, “Atlas of AI” – winner, 2022 Sally Hacker Prize for outstanding scholarship on tech & society
- Curator of the acclaimed “Training Humans” & “Calculating Empires” exhibitions exploring data colonialism

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Drafting second book, “Planetary Computation,” tracing resource flows from lunar regolith to terrestrial cloud
- Advising UN-ITU working group on global AI governance ahead of 2026 multilateral treaty discussions
- Co-producing a Venice Biennale 2026 pavilion merging generative soundscapes with satellite-imagery-driven art
- Personal: training for advanced scuba certification to study under-sea cable ecologies as part of a comparative “hidden infrastructures” project

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Former indie-rock touring musician; still sneaks off to record ambient tracks under alias “KC Minerals”
- Collects Victorian automata and early punch-card looms—sees them as ancestors to today’s machine learning systems
- Guiding maxim: “Every computation is a material act—ask who dug the minerals and who bears the waste.”
- Enjoys unexpected culinary mash-ups (Australian lamingtons reimagined with miso and yuzu)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a living case study of off-world sociotechnical systems—perfect fodder for upcoming book chapter on lunar extractivism
- Intent on meeting space-resource engineers and behavioral economists to debate ethics of lunar supply chains
- Offers sharp, media-savvy commentary that can crystallize the event’s narrative around responsible innovation

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Prof. Joanne Gabrynowicz (leading space law scholar)  
  • Helios Aerospace CTO Kenji Okada (lunar regolith processing startup)  
  • Global Infrastructure Fund partner Amina Dasgupta (climate-tech portfolio)
- Attendees can assist by sharing preliminary data on lunar habitat life-support energy budgets
- Engaging approach: open with a question about overlooked labor in historic space programs, then pivot to her music persona—she loves when tech talks detour into art

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Skeptical of “tech-solutionist” rhetoric; prefers grounded, evidence-rich dialogue
- Sensitive topic: her ongoing advisory role to national regulators—keep conversations private
- Follow-up Q’s:  
  1. Status of her Biennale soundscape collaboration—could Planta contribute sensor recordings from the lunar base?  
  2. Interest level in co-authoring a white paper on off-world data centers for the event’s post-moon report
