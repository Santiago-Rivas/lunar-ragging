### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Peter Gabriel

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Real World Studios estate, Box, Wiltshire, U.K.  
- Secondary foothold: Lower Manhattan loft used for tech-partner sessions and UN-adjacent advocacy work  
- Travel cadence: 10-day bursts—alternates between studio seclusion and global hops for WOMAD, human-rights summits, and immersive-audio demos; avoids long continuous tours to protect hearing  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder, Real World Studios & Real World Records—pioneered fair-trade contracts for global artists  
- Co-founder, WITNESS (human-rights video platform) and The Elders’ “Music for Justice” initiative  
- Four-time Grammy winner; 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Award for Musical Excellence (solo)  
- Current advisory roles with Dolby Laboratories (spatial music) and DeepMind’s “AI for Cultural Heritage” board  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Preparing “i/o : Spatial Harvest” — an adaptive, AI-mixed edition of his 2023 album optimized for 360° and low-gravity listening; beta slated for late-2026  
- Building an open-source toolkit that lets indigenous artists encode ancestral rhythms into ML models without IP loss  
- Personal mission: push music-based neurotherapy trials for PTSD; collaborating with Imperial College London on psilocybin-soundscapes  
- Quiet ambition: secure orbital latency data to perfect real-time cross-planet jam sessions before 2030 Mars window  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Keeps a subterranean greenhouse at Real World; breeds non-terrestrial-viable kale strains “for the first salad on Mars”  
- Lifelong fascination with mythic cosmology—quotes Joseph Campbell: “The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.”  
- Enjoys carpentry; built the adjustable acoustic baffles in his studio himself  
- Surprising tidbit: maintains a private library of 150+ field recordings of frog songs—claims they contain “the planet’s most underrated polyrhythms.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Moon Dinner as a stress-test for his low-gravity audio algorithms and to capture lunar reverberation samples  
- Seeking: collaborators who can provide real-time seismic data from the regolith to feed into generative percussion engines  
- Willing to contribute an exclusive lunar-mixed soundscape for the meal’s reveal sequence; expects only a compact DAW rig and a few binaural headsets  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable intros:  
  • Cynthia Solomon, CTO LunarNet for data-stream APIs  
  • Dr. Hana Okabe, JAXA acoustics lead, for habitat resonance research  
  • Venture partner at Aurora Frontier Fund to back his “Cultural Heritage ML” spin-out  
- Attendee support: beta-test micro-dose/ music therapy protocols, share biometric feedback  
- Engagement tips: open with questions about how frog rhythms could map to lunar ice quakes—he loves left-field analogies; keep conversations idea-centric, not nostalgic about Genesis  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: partial hearing loss in right ear—avoid loud background zones when speaking  
- Prefers first-name basis, minimal formalities  
- Follow-up threads: confirm feasibility of flying his 18-kg analog synth rack; gauge interest in curating a post-event “Moon to Earth” XR exhibition at the British Museum
