- Personal: balancing new motherhood (daughter Shai, born 2023) with tour life; piloting an on-site childcare model for WTA events  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS

- Weekend hobby: wheel-thrown pottery—finds the meditative repetition mirrors service-motion practice  
- Collects vintage astronaut mission patches; believes space exploration “reframes the scale of pressure on the tennis court.”  
- Vocal advocate for destigmatizing mental health; favors tech-enabled, culturally fluent therapy access over generic wellness apps  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable intros:

- Offer backstage hitting session in “lunar-light” court simulation for select attendees—high-visibility photo op  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: still selective about press after 2021 media hiatus; secure her opt-in before filming private conversations  
- Surprising fact she’s ready to share: quietly funding a Haitian coastal mangrove restoration project and has learned basic marine-drone piloting to monitor progress  
- Follow-up Qs: interest level in co-producing a doc on interplanetary sports psychology; timeline for Kinlò’s micro-gravity SPF study results
