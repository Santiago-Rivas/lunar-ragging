### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Evan Spiegel

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Brentwood, Los Angeles
- Secondary foothold: Paris (leverages dual U.S.–French citizenship); splits ~30% of the year in Europe for product teams and EU policy work
- Regular shuttle route: LA ⇄ Seattle ⇄ Tokyo—tracks supplier visits for Spectacles components and semiconductor partnerships

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & CEO, Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) – 406 M daily active users, $4.9 B FY24 revenue
- Architect of the Snap AR ecosystem: Spectacles 4, Lens Studio, Bitmoji Fashion Marketplace
- Philanthropic lead, Spiegel Family Fund—$250 M committed to housing and education in LA

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Rolling out Spectacles 4 “Nova” headset—first consumer-grade, always-on AR with eye-safe laser projection; targeting 2 M units by Q4 2026
- Building a lunar-optimized AR layer with NASA’s HLS team—experimenting with low-latency 3D messaging that works under 2 s signal delay
- Negotiating content studio acquisitions to seed an AI-generated short-form library inside Snapchat Spotlight
- Personally investigating edible protein alternatives for children’s nutrition (inspired by his two young sons); early angel in a mycelium-based formula startup
- Preparing a $100 M Paris Tech Hub expansion, focused on privacy-centric AI chips

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong sailor; trains on 40-ft carbon catamarans—says skippering keeps his “latency instincts” sharp
- Collects Bauhaus-era mechanical wristwatches; appreciates engineering transparency
- Operating maxim: “Design for self-expression, not impression.”
- Surprising fact he enjoys sharing: built a fully functional Theremin in college, still practices late nights to clear his head

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn by the challenge of layering social AR on an extraterrestrial backdrop—wants to demo a holographic Lens that maps lunar regolith into interactive art
- Seeking insight on off-planet user psychology: How does geography-less presence alter friendship graphs?
- Brings deep consumer product intuition, a 20-person Snap experiential crew, and custom “Moon Mode” Spectacles for live field tests
- Hopes to meet frontier-food scientists to discuss palatable, low-mass nutrition options for space tourism

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired:
  • Head of ESA’s Smart Habitats Program  
  • Culinary chemist behind NASA’s printed-food initiative  
  • Quantum communications startups solving Earth-Moon latency
- Offer attendees: mentorship on scaling Gen-Z communities, co-funding for AR-driven art installations, invitation to Snap’s confidential “Lensathon” in Venice Beach
- Engage him with tactile demos; he responds well to prototypes he can tinker with on the spot

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers brief, visually supported conversations—bring diagrams over decks
- Avoid small talk on privacy lawsuits; focus instead on creative constraints
- Follow-up probe: Ask how building the Theremin influenced Spectacles audio architecture—he rarely gets that question and lights up explaining it
