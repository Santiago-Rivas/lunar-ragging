### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Shivon Zilis

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Austin, TX (Neuralink HQ + proximity to SpaceX Starbase)
- Secondary footholds: San Francisco Bay Area (AI ecosystem) and Toronto (family ties, Canadian tech network)
- Travel rhythm: Monthly shuttles to Brownsville launch site; quarterly loops through NYC & London for investor meetings

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Director of Operations & Special Projects, Neuralink Corp. – driving first-in-human BCI clinical program
- Founding Fellow, OpenAI; ex-Partner, Bloomberg Beta (machine-intelligence investment practice)
- Forbes “30 Under 30” alumna; credited with seeding >30 AI startups now valued at $15 B+

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Navigating FDA feedback on Neuralink’s N1 implant; target timeline: full outpatient procedure by Q3 2026
- Building a venture studio around neuro-adaptive interfaces for extreme environments (Mars, deep-sea, Antarctic bases)
- Personal focus: twin toddlers entering bilingual immersion—sparked interest in early-childhood neuroplasticity tools
- Exploring Canada-US research corridor to secure brain-health talent and grants

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Former Yale varsity hockey goaltender; still starts days with dawn rink sessions when schedules permit
- Collects Japanese sencha & Colombian specialty coffees; claims tasting notes sharpen neural pattern recognition
- Guiding philosophy: “Intelligence is a spectrum, not a summit—our job is to widen it for humanity.”
- Weekend project: EEG-driven music synthesizer that turns alpha waves into ambient tracks

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar gathering offers live testbed for cognition-on-lag issues (1.3-second Earth-Moon delay) relevant to BCI latency research
- Keen to swap notes on sensory-modulated cuisine: how low-gravity changes olfactory signaling and appetite loops
- Seeking collaborators on closed-loop mental-health monitoring for off-planet crews
- Can provide thought leadership on ethical frameworks for augmenting human agency in frontier settings

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: NASA Artemis life-support team, ESA neuro-ergonomics group, chefs experimenting with neurogastronomy
- Potential mentor to founders building hardware-software stacks for remote presence or disability tech
- Best engagement approach: bring crisp data or provocative “what-if” scenarios—she thrives on rapid ideation sprints

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Intensely private about family; avoid Musk-centric questions or media angles on parenthood
- Prefers standing or walking meetings; lunar-gravity promenade could double as networking stroll
- Follow-up probe: interest level in co-funding a Moon-based Neural Data Hive pilot—viability, data sovereignty, and partnership structure
