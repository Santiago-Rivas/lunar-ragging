### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Sal Khan

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Mountain View, CA (Khan Academy HQ)
- Regular travel loops: D.C. & Geneva for education-policy forums; Bengaluru & Lagos for emerging-market pilot programs
- Routinely schedules “work-sabbaticals” in Hawaii to film course content and open-water swim at dawn

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Khan Academy (155 M registered learners; operating in 51 languages)
- Chair, Schoolhouse.world (peer-tutoring marketplace) and Khan Lab School (K-12 experimental campus)
- Key achievements:
  • Launched Khanmigo (AI tutor) now delivering 1.3 B chat-based lessons/year  
  • Architect of the 2024 Global Mastery Credential adopted by 9 U.S. states as a diploma supplement  
  • 2025 UNESCO Prize for Innovation in Education

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling a multilingual LLM fine-tuned on mastery learning pedagogy; goal: 95% dropout reduction in low-bandwidth regions
- Negotiating a Space-Ed partnership with NASA to live-stream micro-gravity physics experiments to classrooms worldwide
- Personal: composing a children’s graphic novel on “Math Mysteries of the Multiverse” with his 11-year-old son (target release—holiday 2026)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobbies: tabla percussion, vintage synthesizer tinkering, competitive crossword solving (NYT averages <2 min Tuesday)
- Guiding philosophy: “Access to a great education is a fundamental human right—and our greatest tool for planetary stewardship.”
- Surprising fact worth prompting: once held a minor college record for fastest Rubik’s Cube solve blindfolded (34 sec)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Champion for democratizing knowledge; eager to explore how an off-planet venue can symbolize the next frontier of inclusive learning
- Seeking: collaborators in immersive XR and lunar-based content capture to create the “First Lesson from the Moon” module
- Value offered: can broadcast the dinner’s insights to 20 M+ weekly viewers, framing it as a case study in radical collaboration

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros desired:  
  • Starlink education team (latency solutions)  
  • ESA’s Moonlight initiative leads (lunar comms)  
  • Chef-scientists experimenting with agri-tech for off-world nutrition—potential STEM partnership
- Ways to support him: secure licensing pathway for lunar footage under Creative Commons; share beta access to sensory-feedback wearables for remote learners
- Engaging him: pose a “what would mastery learning look like for lunar settlers?” challenge—he’ll sketch a curriculum on the napkin within minutes

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers data-rich conversations over abstract visioning; comes alive when offered a whiteboard or tablet
- Sensitive angle: currently lobbying against restrictive AI tutoring regulations—avoid on-record policy talk unless in private
- Follow-up query: interest level in co-authoring a Lunar Learning Manifesto with Planta Network thought leaders
