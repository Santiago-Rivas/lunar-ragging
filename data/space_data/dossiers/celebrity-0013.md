- Personal goal: attain instructor-level certifications in Tai Chi and Wing Chun before age 65; treats martial arts as mental operating system  
- Exploring musical theater production themed around Silk Road 3.0 to rekindle China–Middle East cultural exchange  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong English-language enthusiast; still hosts impromptu language-exchange dinners—great ice-breaker in small groups  
- Amateur magician; loves demonstrating a coin-through-glass trick to reset overly formal meetings  
- Guiding maxim: “Today is hard, tomorrow is harder, the day after tomorrow is beautiful—if you’re still alive.”  
- Reads hard sci-fi (Liu Cixin, Kim Stanley Robinson) as strategic foresight practice  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar dinner aligns with his thesis that “commerce follows community”; wants firsthand feel of social dynamics in low-gravity hospitality  
- Actively seeking co-founders for closed-loop agricultural modules suitable for lunar bases and arid Earth regions  
- Can contribute Alibaba Cloud credits, global SME distributor network, and mentorship on scaling marketplace economics in extreme environments  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired:  
  • SpaceX Starshield provisioning team (logistics standards)  
  • Chef José Andrés (food resilience & culinary storytelling)  
  • African Development Bank’s agri-tech lead (dual-use lunar/terrestrial farming)  
- Offer to run a lightning “Moon Commerce” ideation session for younger attendees—valuable spotlight for organizing team  
- Best engagement tactic: invite him to demonstrate a gravity-defying card flourish; transitions naturally into deeper discussion on creativity & risk  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid politics or references to past Ant Group IPO issues—he’s weary of that narrative  
- Prefers conversational surprises; prep a quirky fact (e.g., fungi’s role in regolith remediation) to answer his inevitable “What amazes you lately?”  
- Follow-up probe: gauge his appetite for co-investing in Planta Network’s planned Mars social outpost (2029) before competitors surface
