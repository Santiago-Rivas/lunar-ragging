### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Eliud Kipchoge

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Eldoret, Kenya (Kaptagat Training Camp)
- Split time in Rotterdam & Portland for sponsorship, biomechanics testing
- Pattern: Two major travel waves—spring marathons (Boston/London) and autumn speaking circuits (tech & sustainability summits)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Reigning Olympic marathon champion; first human to run sub-2-hour marathon (INEOS 1:59 Challenge, 2019)
- Co-founder, EK Legacy Foundation—advances youth athletics & reforestation across East Africa
- Strategic partner & brand philosopher, Nike Breaking2 R&D team; influences footwear, recovery tech

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Designing a high-altitude endurance research center outside Eldoret—seeking partners for altitude-to-low-gravity adaptation studies
- Piloting smart-fabric “mindful apparel” with embedded EEG sensors in collaboration with MIT Media Lab
- Personal ambition: transition into ultra-distance trail events by 2027; eyeing World Athletics Council seat to modernize race formats

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Daily 30-minute meditation; credits stoic philosophy—mantra: “No human is limited” (tattooed in Greek on inner wrist—usually hidden by wristbands)
- Amateur beekeeper; maintains 40 hives on family farm to support pollination of indigenous trees
- Fascinated by lunar regolith as a potential carbon-free construction material; reading ESA white papers during recovery sessions
- Collects first-edition African literature—Achebe, Ngũgĩ, and Bessie Head

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence symbolizes the apex of human physical potential meeting off-world ambition; parallels between marathon pacing and mission life-support pacing
- Investigating how low gravity could extend endurance thresholds—looking for physiologists to co-design a “lunar marathon” concept
- Wants candid insights on psychological isolation countermeasures used by astronauts for possible integration into athlete mental training apps
- Can contribute powerful storytelling on discipline, mindset, and ritual—ideal for the event’s content capture team

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intro: Dr. Sheila Patel (NASA Human Performance Lab) for joint altitude–microgravity study
- Seeks regenerative agriculture experts to scale Foundation’s tree-bee initiative—Synergy with Planta’s sustainability messaging
- Engaging tactic: ask about his quiet passion for beekeeping; segue into biodomes on the Moon using pollinator robotics
- Offer behind-the-scenes VR footage of lunar base to inspire his Foundation’s youth STEM programs

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Politely avoid discussing Kenyan athletics federation politics—he keeps that off-record
- Surprising fact prompt: he learned to read by memorizing newspaper scraps while herding goats, leading to lifelong bibliophilia
- Follow-up area: gauge appetite for equity stake in performance-tracking wearables aimed at emerging-market runners
