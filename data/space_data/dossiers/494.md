**FULL NAME:** Marian Croak

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Brooklyn, New York
- Maintains engineering office in Mountain View; alternates two weeks on-site, two weeks remote
- Frequent travel pattern: Washington D.C. (policy briefings), Zurich (Google Research hub), and Nairobi (Sub-Saharan connectivity pilots)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Vice President of Engineering, Google – leads Responsible AI, Network Reliability & Sustainability org (≈2,300 engineers)
- Inventor of core Voice-over-IP patents (200+ total); National Inventors Hall of Fame inductee; member, National Academy of Engineering
- Advisor to NASA’s LunaNet program, shaping delay-tolerant comms standards for cis-lunar operations

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Steering “Equitable Gemini” initiative: fairness & bias-resilience toolkit shipped to all Google generative models by Q4 2025
- Building carbon-aware routing across Google Cloud’s backbone; goal: 60 % real-time clean-energy utilization by 2026
- Co-founding “Croak Catalyst Fund” (launching July 2025) to seed under-represented founders in frontier connectivity
- Personally experimenting with bio-rhythmic audio cues to reduce Zoom fatigue—early prototypes in user testing

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Rooftop Ayurvedic herb garden; curious about closed-loop horticulture for off-Earth habitats
- Keeps a collection of 19th-century fountain pens; hand-writes daily reflections
- Belief: “Tech succeeds when it dissolves into everyday life and amplifies human dignity.”
- Weekend relaxation: singing alto in a Harlem gospel ensemble—few colleagues know she once auditioned for Motown

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Evaluating latency, UX, and psychological impact of lunar social interactions—perfect live-fire scenario for LunaNet specs
- Curious about sensory-rich dining as a data channel (smell, texture, micro-gravity presentation) and how it alters perception of presence
- Brings expertise in trustworthy networks and can advise Planta on resilient off-planet infrastructure and ethical data capture

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX Starlink laser-backhaul team; ESA’s Human-Robot Interaction unit; chef-scientist Heston Blumenthal (multi-sensory gastronomy)
- Ways attendees can help: share real-time human-factor observations; connect her with venture philanthropists focused on education equity
- Engagement tips: open with her unexpected gospel background or rooftop farming; segue into “what dignity looks like in zero-G design”

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers concise, evidence-backed dialogue; strong aversion to hype without substance
- Sensitive point: press frequently misframes her as solely a “diversity figure”—keep focus on technical depth
- Follow-up questions: status of Croak Catalyst Fund LP commitments; interest in joint white-paper on ethical lunar networking
