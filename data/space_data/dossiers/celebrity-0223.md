### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing RC3’s second €60 M fund; eyeing VR/AR platforms that let fans “step onto the pitch” remotely
- Working with ESA’s Human-Performance Lab on low-gravity muscle-retention protocols for future space athletes; pilot study starts Q4 2025
- Personal goal: cement a philanthropic legacy—building 20 multi-sport community centers across Brazil by 2030

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur astrophotographer; travels with a collapsible 140 mm refractor and posts lunar shots under a private alias

- Guiding philosophy: “Velocity with balance”—applies sprint-and-recover tactics from football to business sprints

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the dinner as a live testbed for social VR layering—how holographic fan bases might one day join athletes on-field or on-luna

- Can contribute celebrity pull for public-trust campaigns around commercial lunar travel, drawing parallels to globalization of football

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired:

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers direct questions—will open up if he senses genuine curiosity beyond football anecdotes
- Unusual personal fact (usable for CONVERSATION_GOALS prompt): he designs and 3-D prints custom fins for high-altitude racing drones, inspired by studying ball aerodynamics
- Follow-up area: gauge appetite for co-producing a micro-gravity charity match broadcast from an orbital station in 2029
