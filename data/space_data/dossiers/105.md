### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Mahershala Ali

### IDENTITY & BASE
- Dual base: Brooklyn Heights brownstone (family) & Los Angeles (studio work)
- 2025–26 production schedule keeps him rotating through Atlanta (Marvel soundstages) and Vancouver (streaming limited series)
- Carves out 10-day silent retreat in Northern California every winter; never travels without poetry journals

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Academy Award-winning actor (Moonlight, Green Book); first Muslim actor to secure multiple Oscars
- Founder & CEO, Know Wonder Productions—first-look deal with Apple TV+ focused on “speculative empathy” narratives
- Executive board, Black Filmmakers for Climate Action; marquee voice in Hollywood’s sustainable production movement

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Headlining and co-producing Marvel’s Blade (principal photography wraps Q3 2026); lobbying Disney for on-set renewable-energy mandate
- Developing original XR short “Weightless Words,” fusing spoken-word poetry with zero-gravity cinematography—target festival debut 2027
- Mentoring first cohort of Know Wonder Fellows, five early-career Muslim and Black sci-fi writers
- Personally exploring plant-based culinary science after recent shift to fully vegan lifestyle

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong poet; publishes limited-run chapbooks under pseudonym “H.S. Green”
- Former Division I guard—still sneaks in 6 a.m. pickup games; uses basketball metaphors for ensemble work (“no one dribbles alone in the playoffs”)
- Collects 1960s Afrofuturist art; believes “imagination is a rehearsal for justice”
- Practices Sufi meditation; quotes Rumi on set to center cast & crew

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as research for zero-gravity performance techniques and to scout partnerships for “Weightless Words”
- Eager to exchange ideas on humane tech and how lunar habitats can model circular economies for Earth-based cities
- Can offer star power for Planta’s future experiential campaigns; comfortable narrating or appearing in immersive content filmed in micro-g environments

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable intro: SpaceX/Starlink media operations team (moon-based comms for XR capture); NASA Artemis cultural liaison Dr. Elaine Park
- Interested in meeting avant-garde chefs experimenting with closed-loop agriculture to inform his vegan outreach program
- Best engagement approach: open with poetry or basketball angle, segue into creative tech; ask about his secret chapbook for a disarming hook
- Ready to invest angel-size tickets ($250-500K) in mission-aligned mixed-reality startups with clear pathways to underrepresented storytellers

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers one-on-one exchanges over group spotlight; schedule a quiet corner 10 min after entrée is served
- Sensitive topic: avoids discussing early abandonment of professional basketball dreams—frame sports questions around teamwork, not missed opportunities
- Follow-up probe: ascertain status of Disney renewable-energy clause—could align with Planta sustainability messaging for co-branded content
