### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Kacey Musgraves

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Nashville, TN; maintains writing retreat outside Marfa, West Texas
- Regular circuits through Los Angeles and London for recording, fashion, and fragrance work
- Usually blocks one month each winter for “out-there” travel; Antarctica (2023) and Bhutan (2024) were most recent

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Grammy-winning singer-songwriter; genre-straddling influence in country-pop and Americana
- Founder, Slow Burn Creative—umbrella for fragrance line, design collaborations (Maison Margiela 2024 capsule), and film/TV scoring gigs
- Early investor in SonicBloom, an immersive spatial-audio startup now piloting hardware with Dolby Labs

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing concept album “Starship Rodeo” (Q4 2025) built around cosmic Western imagery; seeking avant-garde sound-design partners
- Quietly negotiating rights to adapt the children’s book “The Darkest Dark” into a musical short, tied to space advocacy for girls
- Growing interest in regenerative ranching on her West Texas land; exploring carbon-negative touring logistics for next world tour
- Personal: completing pilot license with instrument rating; aims to fly herself to select 2026 concert dates

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects vintage Japanese Korg synths; loves discussing analog vs. modular workflows
- Lifelong stargazer—keeps a travel-size refractor telescope on tour buses
- Favorite quote: “Wonder is the antidote to cynicism.”
- Unusual fact she’s eager to share per conversation prompt: can yo-yo walk-the-dog behind her back while singing on pitch (picked up during county-fair circuits)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevant as cultural beacon bridging Americana storytelling with space-age imagination—aligns perfectly with Planta’s “human + tech + awe” ethos
- Seeking introductions to culinary scientists re: “synesthetic dining” concepts that pair taste profiles with live music frequencies
- Would love to record a 30-second “lunar lullaby” on-site using Planta’s acoustic architecture—content could go viral and cross-promo both brands
- Brings value through audience reach (20 M+ socials) and narrative talent to document the event in song or short-form film

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intro desired to SpaceX’s Starshield entertainment liaison about co-developing zero-g concert content
- Could mentor emerging artist-technologists attending; particularly women experimenting with spatial audio or XR storytelling
- Engage her by asking about sonic texture design for silent environments; invite her to test guitar resonance in the lunar dome

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid over-harping on past Grammys—she craves forward-looking dialogue
- Prefers intimate, small-group chats; may retreat if cameras dominate
- Follow-up: confirm if Planta can ship a compact analog synth to the base for her live improvisation segment
