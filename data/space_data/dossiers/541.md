### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** William Kamkwamba

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Lilongwe, Malawi; secondary base: Hanover, New Hampshire (Dartmouth alumni network, R&D access)
- Regular travel loop: Southern Africa → Boston/NYC for fundraising → Nairobi tech corridor for prototyping; first trip to Asia scheduled (Tokyo, Q4 2025, hardware supply talks)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & Executive Director, Moving Windmills Project (community-run renewable energy & STEM labs in rural Malawi)
- Adviser, MIT D-Lab’s “Off-Grid Futures” initiative; TED 2023 Senior Fellow
- Signature achievement: Built a functional wind turbine from scrap at age 14, electrifying his family’s home—story chronicled in bestseller & Netflix film “The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind”

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling 50 solar-plus-storage micro-grids to reach 20 k rural households by mid-2026
- Piloting “FarmBot Mini” autonomous irrigation rigs using repurposed bicycle parts—field trials start August 2025
- Raising $18 M blended capital fund for STEM maker-spaces across East/Southern Africa
- Personal: refining a manuscript on “Frugal Space Engineering” aimed at youth inventors; completion target February 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Recreational astrophotographer—custom-built a motorized star tracker from scrap printer gears
- Obsessed with Malawian percussion rhythms; travels with a handmade djembe (great ice-breaker at after-hours gatherings)
- Guiding philosophy: “If you don’t have the parts, create the parts.” Frequently cites Bemba proverb “Where there is no river, dig a well.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Brings hard-won expertise in off-grid power, closed-loop water systems, and DIY fabrication—directly relevant to lunar habitat self-sufficiency
- Curious about in-situ resource utilization (lunar regolith → concrete) and how frugal engineering principles can bridge Earth-Moon tech transfer
- Seeking collaborators for a 2027 “Space-Ready Maker Lab” curriculum that blends his wind-turbine story with extraterrestrial engineering challenges
- Offers compelling keynote or fireside content on resilience, youth empowerment, and resource-scarcity creativity

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA’s Artemis sustainability team; Blue Origin’s life-support R&D leads; Schmidt Futures community energy program officers
- Attendees can help with: sensor donations for micro-grid telemetry; pro-bono IP counsel on open-source hardware licensing; connections to lunar regolith materials researchers
- Engage him by: inviting a quick design-thinking sketch session over dinner napkins; asking about his star-tracker build; showing him any makeshift tool benches aboard the lunar base

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Humble to a fault; gently steer conversation to highlight his technical depth, not just the childhood windmill narrative
- Prefers concrete data over visionary hype—arrive with tangible failure rates, power curves, or material specs
- Surprising fact to surface per conversation goal: he moonlights as a freestyle football (soccer) juggler—record is 1,216 touches without dropping
- Follow-up targets: gauge interest in co-authoring a children’s graphic novel on lunar sustainability; explore joint grant application with Planta for rural-to-lunar knowledge exchange
