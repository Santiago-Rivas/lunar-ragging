### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Nonny de la Peña

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Venice Beach, Los Angeles  
- Secondary: Downtown Phoenix (ASU Narrative & Emerging Media Lab)  
- Typical travel loop: NYC → Geneva → Singapore for XR policy roundtables; annual pilgrimages to Sundance & SXSW

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Emblematic Group – immersive-storytelling studio hailed for first VR doc at Sundance (“Hunger in L.A.”, 2012)
- Founding Director, ASU + LA “Narrative & Emerging Media” graduate program
- Peabody-Award winner; dubbed “Godmother of VR” by Engadget
- Advisor, World Economic Forum Metaverse Governance Initiative

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Commercial launch of REACH 2.0: cloud-based volumetric capture toolkit integrating Gen-AI narrative scripting
- Securing $25 M Series B to expand newsroom partnerships ahead of 2026 U.S. election cycle (goal: 100 local stations producing immersive reports)
- Prototyping micro-gravity camera rig for on-orbit volumetric capture (“Project Apogee”)—target demo: Q3 2026
- Personal: carving weekly “deep work” blocks to finish memoir on immersive journalism’s early wild years

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Moonlights as a rescue-dog pilot—flies surplus shelter pets from L.A. to Pacific Northwest on weekends (“nothing centers you like 8,000 ft in a Cessna with a terrier”)
- Food obsessive: makes her own Hatch-chile molé; hunts for rare freeze-dry techniques to preserve flavor in space
- Philosophy: “Empathy is a muscle; immersive tech is the gym.”  
- Reads Golden Age sci-fi for relaxation; cites Ursula K. Le Guin’s “The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction” as creative north star

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the event as live case study for social presence beyond Earth—intends to capture volumetric vox-pops in lunar gravity for a mixed-reality short
- Looking for collaborators with radiation-hardened sensor expertise and chefs experimenting with multisensory cues in low-pressure environments
- Can provide Planta Network with narrative frameworks turning the dinner into a persistent social VR experience for global audiences

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: SpaceX Starship comms team (payload allocations), ESA XR research unit, chef-scientist Heston Blumenthal (gastric perception in altered gravity)
- Attendees can help by sharing lessons on life-support grade hardware and lunar logistics, or co-investing in REACH 2.0’s “Space Module”
- Engage her by asking what she learned flying rescue dogs that applies to designing humane tech—she’ll light up and segue into embodiment science

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Rapid talker; appreciates succinct counterpoints—don’t mirror hype, bring data
- Allergic to pistachios (flag for catering)
- Follow-up Qs: status of FAA sign-off on Project Apogee flight tests; timeline for memoir rights (film adaptation interest is brewing)
