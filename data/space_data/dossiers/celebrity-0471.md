### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Jonathan Haidt

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: New York City (Greenwich Village apartment + NYU Stern office)
- Maintains a small writing retreat in Charlottesville, VA; retreats monthly for deep-work sprints
- Heavy travel cadence: 2-3 university lectures per month in North America + quarterly policy briefings in D.C. and Brussels

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership, NYU Stern School of Business
- Co-founder, Heterodox Academy; Senior Advisor, Institute for Family & Social Media
- Author of global best-sellers The Righteous Mind and The Coddling of the American Mind; Substack newsletter “After Babel” surpassing 500 K subscribers
- Leading public intellectual on moral psychology, polarization, and youth mental health in the digital age

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finishing forthcoming book, The Anxious Generation (spring 2026), arguing for a “slow tech” childhood and radical K-12 phone reform
- Building “Digital Playbook for Healthy Campuses,” a toolkit for 200+ universities piloting phone-free dorms and AI-moderated discourse norms
- Raising a $25 M philanthropic fund to seed evidence-based social-media design experiments that reduce teen self-harm metrics by 30 %
- Personally experimenting with VR-assisted empathy training modules for conflict-resolution workshops
- On sabbatical 2025-26; goal: draft moral-psychology framework for interplanetary governance (early whitepaper circulating at NASA’s Office of Technology, Policy & Strategy)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Avid salsa dancer; practices twice weekly—claims it rebooted his “moral tastebuds” after marathon writing sessions
- Collects antique illusionist props; fascination with “moral magic tricks” that misdirect group reasoning
- Guiding principle: “Prepare the elephant before persuading the rider”—orient emotions first, argue second
- Surprising fact for CONVERSATION_GOALS: once trained capuchin monkeys in Costa Rica for a cognition study—still wears a braided wristband gifted by field assistants

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to explore moral-psychology implications of off-Earth communities; poised to discuss cooperative norms in low-gravity, high-risk settings
- Seeks collaborators in lunar architecture, gastronomy, and XR who can integrate “moral friction” cues—design elements that slow harmful group cascades
- Can contribute a keynote vignette on “tribalism at 1/6th g”—how scarcity myths could undermine lunar cohesion

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: 
  • Planta’s behavioral-science team refining social-interface UX  
  • Private spaceflight insurers exploring ethical-risk communication  
  • Philanthropists interested in youth-digital-wellbeing endowments
- Helpful offers from attendees: beta access to closed-loop feedback data from lunar social experiments; lab time with neuro-sensory equipment to test mood regulation in altered gravity
- Ideal engagement: invite him to small, intellectually playful salons rather than large mixers; he thrives in 4-6 person debates

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers first-name basis; keep discussion concrete—he disengages from abstract moralizing without data
- Sensitive topic: avoids partisan U.S. politics—shifts swiftly to bipartisan reform framing
- Follow-up question: What metrics would convince him that a lunar community is psychologically “anti-fragile”?
