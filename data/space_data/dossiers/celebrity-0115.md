### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Ryan Gosling

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Feliz, Los Angeles; secondary retreat on Ontario’s Lake Muskoka
- Regular filming cycles in London and Atlanta; quick to hop trans-Pacific for Japan-based motorcycle events

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Actor-producer, founder 2020 of General Atlas Films (first-look deal with Warner Bros.)
- Breakout roles: La La Land, Blade Runner 2049, Barbie (2023 global gross $1.4 B)
- Cultural cachet: two Oscar noms, Time 100 (2024), SAG ambassador for Creative Climate Action

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Pre-production on “Eon” — an original sci-fi miniseries exploring multigenerational lunar colonies (shooting mid-2026)
- Quietly assembling a venture slate focused on low-impact propellant tech and closed-loop food systems for space habitats
- Personal: curating a father-daughters children’s book line about resilient curiosity; pilot manuscript due this summer

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobbies: jazz piano (keeps a portable roll-up keyboard on set), high-precision watchmaking, vintage café racers
- Keeps a studio woodshop; makes one bespoke piece per film as a “time-capsule object”
- Guiding lens: “Craft over noise—if it can’t be felt in silence, it isn’t authentic”
- Surprising tidbit: owns the original Gemini 8 flight checklist pages—sparked his fascination with lunar history during First Man research

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as immersive R&D for “Eon”; intends to record audio diaries on lunar acoustics
- Wants candid chats with bio-regenerative agriculture experts and lunar architects about livable textures (color, smell, sound) inside domes
- Brings cinematic storytelling instincts and mass-appeal visibility—valuable for post-event documentary or narrative spin-offs

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Prime intro targets: Planta’s sensory UX team, SpaceX propulsion chemists, Michelin-level zero-gravity chefs
- Would appreciate a tour of the base’s hydroponic lab to compare with his investment prospectus
- Best engagement: invite him to co-design the dinner’s ambient playlist or to test-pilot the holographic memory wall; he responds well to hands-on creative collaboration

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Media-averse in public spaces; maintain a low-key approach—avoid flash photography requests
- Warm toward discussions framed around family, mentorship, or practical sustainability
- Follow-up: gauge interest in narrating Planta’s post-mission short film; confirm if his watch micro-brand can supply mission-dated commemorative pieces
