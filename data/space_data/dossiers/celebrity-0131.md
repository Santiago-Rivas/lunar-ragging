### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Willem Dafoe

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Splits time between Trastevere, Rome loft and a minimalist SoHo, NYC studio
- On-location 200+ days/year; recent shoots in Reykjavík, Mexico City, and a three-week underwater tank residency in Malta
- Regularly schedules “silent-week” retreats in remote monasteries before major roles

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Actor–producer with 130+ screen credits; co-founder of avant-garde troupe The Wooster Group
- Four-time Academy Award nominee; Cannes Volpi Cup winner; SAG “Lifetime of Risk” award 2024
- Current advisory roles: Sundance New Frontiers Lab (immersive storytelling) and ESA Arts & Science Council

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Filming “Valence,” a zero-G psychological thriller commissioned by A24 + SpaceX, training at Johnson Space Center
- Developing a VR/AR stage piece, “The Body Electric,” blending butoh movement with generative AI choreography
- Personal: restoring a 300-year-old olive grove outside Orvieto; first biodynamic oil harvest planned for fall 2026
- Seeking narratives that merge ecological cautionary tales with speculative optimism; open to co-writing credits

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Daily Ashtanga practice, cold-water immersion, and 12-min breath-hold record from “Aquaman 2” prep
- Collects outsider art—especially found-object sculpture—and trades pieces directly with emerging artists
- Guiding maxim: “Stay curious, stay uncomfortable, stay alive.”
- Surprising fact for the host’s prompt: spent part of 1974 touring Midwest roller-derby arenas as a lighting tech, still skates to clear his head

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Rehearsing microgravity movement sequences; eager to observe how dinner guests adapt body language on the lunar surface
- Wants candid dialogue on loneliness vs. connectivity in off-Earth habitats—data for “Valence” script rewrites
- Brings star power that will amplify Planta’s mission; prepared to record a short poetic vignette for the Network’s documentary reel

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Intro wish-list: XR sensory-mapping startup founders, NASA behavioral scientists, avant-chef Dominique Crenn (for future art-food collab)
- Can mentor early-career actors attending the mission on maintaining craft under extreme conditions
- Engage him by asking about olive-oil fermentation tricks or the biomechanics of acting with harness rigs—he’ll light up

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers informal, eye-level conversations; avoids Marvel nostalgia chatter
- Sensitive to synthetic fragrances; lunar habitat air filters matter
- Follow-up: invite him to sample Planta’s mood-adaptive light installation—a potential cameo venue for “The Body Electric” test footage
