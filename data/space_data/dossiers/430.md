### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Chris Sacca

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Jackson Hole, WY ranch; secondary workspace in Austin’s East Side climate-tech corridor  
- Annual orbit: Bay Area (board weeks), Berlin & Nairobi (Lowercarbon demo days), 2–3 stealth scouting trips to Pacific atolls for bio-sequestration pilots  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-Founder & Managing Partner, Lowercarbon Capital – $2 B climate-tech fund backing 300+ startups across carbon removal, fusion, and regenerative ag  
- Notable early bets: Twitter, Uber, Stripe (via Lowercase Capital); SPAC advisor for Planet Labs IPO  
- Media voice: Frequent guest on Pivot & The Journal podcasts; Emmy nomination for Hulu doc “Fire on Ice” chronicling methane-free steel  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing new $750 M “Frontier Earth” fund focused on hard-tech that extends humanity off-planet while decarbonizing home-planet supply chains  
- Incubating a lunar regolith-to-battery startup with ex-SpaceX engineers; aims for in-situ manufacturing by 2028  
- Personally drafting a “Carbon Peace Accord” framework—global treaty proposal tying space resource rights to CO₂ drawdown commitments  
- Relearning Spanish with his kids to prep for LATAM clean-energy deployments  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate backcountry skier; swears by silent dawn skin-ups for clearing investment headspace  
- Collects vintage Federal Communications Commission patches; says they remind him “regulation is history written in embroidery”  
- Favorite maxim: “Change the denominator, not the numerator”—spends more time shrinking planetary emissions than chasing personal returns  
- Secret talent: Was a competitive a cappella beatboxer at Georgetown—rarely divulged outside close circles  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Funding ventures enabling sustainable off-Earth living—perfect fit for Planta’s lunar hospitality prototype  
- Seeking: Founders working on closed-loop food systems, lunar construction, and neuro-social tech that keeps remote teams cohesive across light-second delays  
- Contribution: Can syndicate $5–10 M seed checks within 48 hrs; offers regulatory strategy playbooks from FCC, FAA, and NASA partnerships  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • Dr. Lisa Dyson (Air Protein) for lunar protein fermentation  
  • Lt. Gen. John Shaw (USSF) on cislunar traffic rules  
  • Chef Dominique Crenn—exploring zero-waste haute cuisine in micro-gravity  
- Attendees can assist by sharing: bioreactor uptime data, scalable lunar logistics models, or talent referrals for deep-tech storytellers  
- Engage him over: unconventional board governance tricks, ski lines in Tyrol, or why steelmaking on the Moon could slash Earth emissions  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers direct, irreverent humor; long PowerPoints lose him after slide five  
- Avoid leading with crypto pitches—publicly skeptical since 2022 carbon-token fiasco  
- Follow-up Qs:  
  • Status of his in-house “Dark Labs” lunar battery spin-out  
  • Interest level in co-hosting a live recording of Pivot from the Moon’s Sea of Tranquility dome
