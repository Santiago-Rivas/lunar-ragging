### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Tu Youyou

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Beijing, China; maintains an apartment near the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (CACMS)
- Restricts long-haul travel; favors short research residencies in Hong Kong and Singapore and will rely on a low-gravity medical escort for lunar transit

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chief Scientist, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, CACMS
- Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (2015) for discovery of artemisinin, credited with saving 20+ million lives
- Leads Sino-African Artemisinin Elimination Alliance; consults for WHO on drug-resistance surveillance

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Final stage trials of “ArteNova X,” an inhalable artemisinin nano-aerosol designed for vaccine-hesitant regions
- Advocating for a global “Pharmaco-Botanical Commons” to open-source genomic data of medicinal plants
- Personal project: cataloguing space-grown herbs to compare secondary metabolite profiles under micro-gravity—proposal already funded by China’s National Space Science Center
- Mentoring a cross-disciplinary team exploring AI-generated molecular analogues to combat emerging zoonotic fevers

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong calligrapher; practices before every major lecture to calm nerves—often gifts attendees a personalized character
- Collects Tang-dynasty poetry on resilience; favorite line: “Medicine and humanity share one heart”
- Fascinated by culinary pharmacology—believes “taste is the first dose”; eager to sample how lunar chefs incorporate adaptogenic botanicals

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Planta’s lunar farm is trialing hydroponic qinghao (sweet wormwood); Tu wants firsthand data for space-bioactive comparisons
- Seeks dialogue on supply-chain ethics for extraterrestrial agriculture and how policy can prevent a repeat of Earth-side biopiracy
- Offers: can share 50-year longitudinal data on plant-derived antimalarials—valuable case study for framing lunar bio-innovation standards

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to: 
  • ESA’s Melissa life-support biologists  
  • Blue Origin’s orbital manufacturing unit exploring plant alkaloid extraction
- Attendees could assist by co-authoring a position paper on “Space Pharmaco-Ethics” slated for Lancet Planetary Health (2026)
- Engaging tips: open with curiosity about how she balanced ancient texts with modern R&D; offer a taste comparison between Earth-grown and lunar-grown herbal infusions

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Surprising fact: she played erhu in a covert Beijing youth orchestra during the Cultural Revolution—rarely mentioned publicly
- Sensitive: fatigues quickly in loud settings; schedule any deep dives early in the evening or during quieter orbital night cycles
- Follow-up questions: status of WHO grant renewal for Artemisinin Resistance Mapping 2.0; interest level in serving as honorary chair for Planta’s forthcoming “Space Apothecary Initiative”
