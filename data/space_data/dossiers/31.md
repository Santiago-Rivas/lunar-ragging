### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** NASSIM NICHOLAS TALEB

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: New York City (Upper West Side apartment + NYU office)
- Maintains a family home in Amioun, Lebanon; summers split between Levantine mountains and Côte d’Azur
- Regular lecture circuit: London, Zurich, Abu Dhabi; rarely spends more than 10 consecutive weeks in one country

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Distinguished Professor of Risk Engineering & Scientific Method, NYU Tandon
- Author of the Incerto series (5 M+ copies in 41 languages); coined “Black Swan,” “Antifragile,” “Skin in the Game”
- Partner, Universa Investments—advises on tail-risk hedging for sovereign wealth funds

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing research paper on “ergodicity violations” in human longevity & space habitats
- Building a boutique institute in Beirut to train local quants in extreme-value theory
- Weightlifting every other day; goal: deadlift 405 lb at age 65—plans to test max pull in lunar gravity for publicity
- Draft notes for Incerto addendum “Silence” exploring wisdom of subtraction in decision-making

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobbies: rare Aramaic manuscripts, Levantine olive cultivation, barbell training, chess blitz on Lichess (handle: ‘realfattony’)
- Guiding maxims: “If you see fraud and don’t say fraud, you are a fraud.”  “Via negativa > via positiva.”
- Surprising fact he enjoys sharing: once turned down a Rhodes Scholarship to work the trading pits in Chicago, “best non-credential of my life.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a live case study in low-probability, high-impact risk management; wants to audit life-support redundancies and escape protocols
- Seeks conversations on: antifragile design of closed-loop ecosystems, moral hazard in commercial space tourism, statistical illusions caused by lunar low-entropy environments
- Offers provocative keynote vignette on “Lunar Black Swans” and willingness to run an impromptu thought experiment with attendees

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: 
  • SpaceX Starshield reliability team  
  • Calico Labs’ gerontology statisticians  
  • Saudi PIF’s tech fund regarding Beirut institute endowment
- Attendees could assist by sharing biomedical micro-gravity datasets for his ergodicity study
- Best engagement tactic: challenge him with a specific numerical problem or paradox; avoid generalities and flattery

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Dislikes hedged language—state views plainly, accept debate
- Allergic to “conference swag”; appreciates quality black coffee and unfiltered olive oil
- Possible follow-up: invite him to co-author an essay on risk ethics in extraterrestrial settlements; secure time before he enters a three-week “writing fast” each February
