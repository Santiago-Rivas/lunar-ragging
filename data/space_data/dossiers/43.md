### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Willie Nelson

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Spicewood, TX (Luck Ranch); maintains songwriting hideaway on Maui
- Touring loop remains U.S.–Europe–Japan; prefers routing that returns him to Texas every 3–4 weeks to oversee ranch and biodiesel lab

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Legendary singer-songwriter; catalog exceeds 3,500 compositions, 75 M records sold
- Co-founder, Farm Aid (raised $70 B+ for family farmers)
- Founder, Willie’s Reserve & Willie’s Remedy (cannabis & wellness lines stocked in 28 states)
- 11-time Grammy winner; Kennedy Center Honors; Library of Congress Gershwin Prize

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Recording “Out of This World,” an all-analog album engineered for vacuum-sealed vinyl that can be played in lunar gravity—release timed to the 2027 dinner
- Scaling hemp-based bioplastics venture with University of Texas engineers; targeting aerospace food packaging
- Quietly funding rural broadband satellites through a new SPV, “Highwayman Orbital,” to connect farming communities
- Personal: wants to cross “guitar solo under Earth-rise” off his bucket list; training with SpaceX centrifuge twice a month

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Daily 30-minute martial-arts routine (5th-degree black belt, Gong Kwon Yusul)—rarely publicized
- Reads quantum physics papers “for melody ideas”; believes music and gravity share harmonic ratios
- Favorite maxim: “If you ain’t thinking ahead, you’re already behind.”
- Collects rare seeds; keeps them “just in case the stars need farming”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited as cultural pillar to test how live music affects group cohesion in microgravity
- Seeks dialogue on closed-loop hydroponics and hemp fiber applications for lunar habitats
- Brings global media attention; likely to livestream a short set to 40 M followers
- Open to co-creating a signature “Zero-G Hash Rosin” with Planta if on-site biolab permits

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to: NASA’s Space Crop Production team; Blue Origin’s payload integration lead; Patagonia’s materials R&D chief
- Attendees can assist by sharing data on lunar radiation shielding for organic matter
- Engage him with a backstage “seed swap” or a quick jam—he always carries Trigger #2 (travel version of his iconic guitar)

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers informal conversation over formality; eye contact and a good joke win trust
- Sensitive topic: refrain from calling him a “legacy act”—he bristles; frame as “frontier artist”
- Follow-up Q for deeper bond: ask why he keeps a faded copy of The Tao Te Ching in his flight suit pocket
