### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Isha Datar

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Toronto, Canada  
- Secondary hub: Boston–Cambridge biotech corridor (monthly lab & investor meetings)  
- Emerging travel pattern: regular stints at ESA’s ESTEC (Noordwijk) and NASA Ames for micro-gravity food research partnerships  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Executive Director, New Harvest (global nonprofit accelerating cellular agriculture)  
- Co-founder: Perfect Day (animal-free dairy) and EVERY Company (egg proteins) – both now unicorn-status suppliers to CPG giants  
- TED Fellow; frequent advisor to OECD, FAO, and Singapore Food Agency on alt-protein regulation  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Launching the “Open Cell Ag Research Commons” – a public–private database of cell lines, scaffolds, and bioreactor protocols slated to go live Q4 2025  
- Driving a $75 M capital campaign to endow the first university department dedicated to cellular agriculture (negotiations with University of Guelph & Wageningen)  
- Personal focus: proving low-gravity cultivation of muscle and fat tissues; supervising a parabolic-flight pilot scheduled November 2025  
- Writing a manifesto-style book (working title: “Meat Without Earth”) targeting mainstream release pre-2027 lunar dinner  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend metal-sculpture hobbyist; builds abstract “bio-steel” pieces from fermentation-derived alloys  
- Collects vintage Canadian postage stamps—says it keeps her “grounded in physical artifacts while designing post-physical food.”  
- Guiding philosophy: “Technology should reduce, not reproduce, the footprint of our desires.”  
- Often quotes Buckminster Fuller: “You never change things by fighting existing reality; build a new model that makes the old model obsolete.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to demonstrate feasibility of producing gourmet protein on the lunar base; arrived with freeze-dried starter cells of heritage Wagyu and bluefin tuna  
- Actively seeking collaborators in closed-loop life-support, 3-D food printing, and lunar regolith-derived nutrient extraction  
- Brings credibility as the public face of ethical, scalable food tech—ideal for media narratives around the dinner  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to:  
  • Senior partners at SpaceX’s Starshield agriculture division  
  • Venture arms of Danaher & Thermo Fisher for bioreactor hardware sponsorship  
  • Astrobiologists studying extremophile metabolism (input for her low-gravity protocol)  
- Offers: can connect attendees to New Harvest’s 120-startup fellowship pipeline; happy to guest-lecture on mission-aligned university programs  
- Best engagement tactic: ask her to brainstorm “impossible” menus for Mars colonies—she lights up when stretching biotech toward science-fiction use cases  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: New Harvest’s push for open IP occasionally clashes with founders chasing patents; tread carefully if discussing exclusivity  
- Surprising fact prompt: She once incubated mushroom leather on her apartment walls to test off-grid materials  
- Follow-up angle: status of her in-orbit tissue culture cubes launching aboard SpaceX CRS-35 in February 2026
