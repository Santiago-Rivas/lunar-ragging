### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Esther Dyson

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Lower Manhattan, New York City  
- Rotates monthly through the five “Wellville” pilot communities (Muskegon MI, Lake County CA, Clatsop County OR, Niagara NY, Spartanburg SC)  
- Regular space-industry circuits: Houston, Cape Canaveral, and Star City (keeps Russian visa current from her 2008 cosmonaut training)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Executive Founder, Way to Wellville (10-year community health experiment ending 2028)  
- Chair, EDventure Holdings – personal fund backing >200 early-stage tech, health & space companies  
- Notable wins: Flickr, 23andMe, Omada Health, SpaceX series A advisor; former ICANN chair steering 1998 internet governance transition

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Preparing Wellville’s final impact report & seeking models to replicate its preventive-health economics at state level  
- Angel investments closing Q4 2025: two longevity-biotech labs and a Lunar agri-microbiome startup (stealth)  
- Drafting book “The Long Game of Health” (working title) targeting 2026 release  
- Personal aim: secure seat on first commercial “long-dwell” lunar-orbit mission to study circadian disruption

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Licensed pilot; logs weekly stick-time in a Cirrus SR22 to “keep judgment sharp”  
- Fluent Russian; studies Mandarin on Duolingo “to stay humble”  
- Guiding belief: “Systems beat heroes—design the system right and the heroes will emerge.”  
- Relaxation: 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzles of historical star maps; uses them for meditative focus

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- One of the few attendees with formal spaceflight survival training; adds gravitas to the “human factors” discussion  
- Wants candid dialogue on maintaining mental well-being in confined habitats and designing default-healthy food systems for off-world living  
- Brings 40-year lens on tech governance—can translate between regulators, entrepreneurs, and scientists for any lunar settlement blueprint

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Seeks intros to:  
  • Planta’s sensory-feedback chefs (link to Wellville’s nutrition researchers)  
  • Venture arms of JAXA & CSA for co-funding her lunar microbiome venture  
  • Sociologists studying group dynamics in isolated environments  
- Offers: open office hours post-dinner for founders; can fast-track promising projects to XPRIZE & Schmidt Futures grant evaluators  
- Engage her with thoughtful contrarian questions; she rewards intellectual sparring and dislikes rehearsed pitches

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Conversation ice-breaker: ask about her zero-gravity violin lesson in Star City—few know she plays Baroque pieces  
- Sensitive: avoids public political commentary on current US-Russia tensions; keep space-training anecdotes apolitical  
- Follow-up angle: invite her to record a short video diary on lunar base health insights for Wellville’s final report—she’ll view it as high-impact storytelling
