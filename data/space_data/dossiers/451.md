- Partnering with NVIDIA and ESA to integrate lunar-based sensors into global health and climate models (“Moon-to-Earth Data Loop”)  
- Piloting an AR classroom curriculum that lets students “fly through” time-series data; beta tests start Q3 2025 in 12 countries  
- Personal: aiming to kayak the entire Swedish archipelago in summer 2026; uses the journey to live-stream micro-lectures on biodiversity

- Warm introductions desired to:  
  • Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin – for access to orbital data streams  
  • Dr. Fei-Fei Li, Stanford HAI – potential joint fellowship on AI-literacy for policymakers
