### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Margaret Court

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Perth, Western Australia; resides near Victory Life Centre compound
- Regular loop: Melbourne (Australian Open commentary), Singapore (regional Pentecostal network), Dallas (annual faith-and-sport symposium)
- Travels with a compact medical team; prefers red-eye flights to protect public privacy

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Senior Pastor, Victory Life Centre (12,000+ weekly congregants; robust online campus across 54 nations)
- Former World No. 1 tennis player; record holder of 24 Grand Slam singles titles
- Patron, Court Performance Institute – research hub blending elite sport science with spiritual well-being

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Launching a VR “Global Locker Room” ministry by Q4 2026 to mentor young athletes in remote regions
- Commissioning academic study on faith-based resilience practices for prolonged isolation (target audience: polar researchers and prospective lunar settlers)
- Personal project: editing an unpublished notebook of plant-based performance recipes developed during her 1970 Grand Slam season

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects vintage botanical illustrations; fascinated by how micro-gravity alters plant morphology
- Daily routine still includes 5 a.m. interval training and cold-water swims in the Indian Ocean
- Guiding principle: “Discipline births freedom” – frames every conversation around self-mastery
- Enjoys discussing how great serves resemble prayer: precise, intention-filled, unseen by opponent until contact

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited as “Human Performance Legend” to spark dialogue on sustaining peak physical and spiritual health off-planet
- Eager to meet food-tech innovators refining nutrient-dense crops for lunar habitats (ties to her recipe manuscript)
- Intends to propose a cross-disciplinary study with Planta on “mind-body synchrony in 1/6 g” using elite athletes and clergy volunteers
- Brings gravitas and an articulate narrative on overcoming pressure—valuable content for media capture

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Seeks warm intro to: 
  • Dr. Hiroshi Tanaka (JAXA life-science lead)  
  • Serena Ventures team for potential scholarship co-fund 
- Attendees can assist by sharing prototypes of compact fitness rigs or communion-capable food systems for micro-gravity
- Best engagement tactic: ask for her take on how lunar isolation parallels the mental rigor of solo competitions; segue into surprises she uncovered during recipe testing

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Publicly holds conservative social views; steer initial dialogue toward sport science or lunar agriculture to avoid polarizing detours
- Health watch: mild atrial fibrillation—keep intensity conversations seated, offer low-sodium options at dinner
- Follow-up questions:  
  1) Status of VR ministry platform beta testers  
  2) Will she release her lunar-adapted “Bush Protein Bar” formula under open license or proprietary brand?
