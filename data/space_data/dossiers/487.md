### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Linda Rothenberg

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Angeles, CA (studio kitchen + R&D lab near JPL)
- Secondary hub: Houston, TX (Johnson Space Center liaison office)
- Quarterly circuits through Copenhagen & Tokyo for culinary-tech exchange; prefers red-eye flights to free daylight hours for deep work

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Lumen Gastronomy Lab – pioneers closed-loop, zero-waste food systems for microgravity environments
- Former Lead Nutritional Scientist, NASA Advanced Life Support Program; co-designed menus for Artemis III crew
- James Beard “Innovator of the Year” 2024; holds five patents spanning edible 3D-printing substrates and mycelium-based packaging

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing Series B ($60 M) to scale on-orbit bioreactors that convert CO₂ into single-cell protein
- Negotiating pilot with ESA to install her modular “Celestine Greenhouse” on Gateway Station by 2028
- Personally composing a multisensory “taste symphony” integrating audio frequencies to modulate perceived flavor intensity—target debut: SXSW 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend ultramarathoner; claims long-distance training sparks her best flavor-pairing ideas
- Maintains a private collection of antique spice journals dating to the Age of Sail—studies them for lessons on preservation pre-refrigeration
- Guiding philosophy: “Cuisine is the earliest form of systems engineering.” Keeps meetings focused on inputs, transformations, and outputs
- Surprising fact she rarely shares: played professional theremin in a European avant-garde orchestra before pivoting to biochemistry

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Directly responsible for the dinner’s regenerative menu and atmospheric aroma cues; attending both as creator and observer
- Eager to capture candid sensory feedback for a white paper on human taste perception above low-Earth gravity
- Seeking dialogue with VR/AR designers to layer real-time flavor visualization overlays for future orbital pop-ups
- Brings credibility in sustainable food loops; can articulate tangible pathways from lunar trials to terrestrial climate-resilient agriculture

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: 
  • Plant-based pioneer Dr. Song-Yi Park (Mirai Foods)  
  • Lunar construction startup Helios Habitat for integrated greenhouse modules
- Valuable to attendees: can demystify food safety certs for off-planet venues and open doors at NASA & JAXA procurement desks
- Engagement tips: ask about her spice journals or the correlation between 40 Hz audio and umami amplification—guaranteed animated discussion
- Offer a short post-dinner VR demo space for her flavor visualization prototype; she appreciates concrete testbeds

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid marketing buzzwords—she has zero tolerance for “phygital” or “food-tainment” clichés
- Prefers black coffee over alcohol; schedule follow-ups in the morning whenever possible
- Good follow-up question: status of her microgravity fermentation study with Kyoto University and whether she needs beta tasters on future parabolic flights
