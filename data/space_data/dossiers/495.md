### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Marina Gorbis

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Palo Alto, CA (Institute for the Future HQ)
- Splits time with a pied-à-terre in Brooklyn to stay plugged into East-Coast policy circles
- Annual “foresight tour” circuit: Singapore, Helsinki, Kigali, and Buenos Aires—signals-scouting for emerging social experiments

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Executive Director, Institute for the Future (IFTF) since 2006; 40-person nonprofit think-tank shaping long-range strategy for governments, Fortune 100s, and NGOs
- Architect of IFTF’s Socialstructed Futures framework; authored the book “The Nature of the Future”
- Advisor to World Bank’s Digital Economy initiative and UNESCO’s Future Literacy Labs

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Launching IFTF’s “Beyond Planetary” program—scenarios for off-Earth governance, mutual aid, and cultural rituals (2025-2027)
- Co-designing a mixed-reality foresight game with Epic Games to crowdsource 100K lunar lifestyle stories
- Writing a new book: “Belonging After Gravity” (manuscript due mid-2026) examining how intimacy, trust, and surprise scale in space habitats
- Personally learning Japanese to access original texts on kintsugi and repair culture—sees it as a metaphor for regenerative futures

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend passion: urban dérive walks, photographing overlooked infrastructure; publishes a monthly zine “Edges & Gaps”
- Lifelong collector of Soviet-era science-fiction illustrations
- Guiding maxim: “The future is less about prediction, more about invitation.”
- Believes surprise is a design tool—asks leaders to surface the “unknown-knowns” that rewire assumptions

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Treats the Dinner Party as living-lab data for “surprise triggers” in extreme environments; intends to run a 10-minute micro-probe with guests: “Name one thing about you no algorithm could predict.”
- Seeking stories for the new book and partners for the mixed-reality foresight game—especially chefs, habitat engineers, and neuro-design researchers
- Offers rapid-fire scenario sessions to anyone exploring lunar commerce, governance, or community rituals; can translate insights into actionable 5-year roadmaps

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Moon Village Association governance team  
  • Patagonia’s Regenerative Supply-Chain Lab (space-grade textiles)  
  • Blackstone Space Ventures—potential funding for foresight game
- Attendees can help by sharing personal “origin surprises” and data on psychological safety in confined habitats
- Best engagement strategy: invite her to co-draft a future headline on a cocktail napkin; she carries colored Sharpies for impromptu futures sketching

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers intimate clusters over stage-mic spotlights; schedule any on-camera segments early to free her for field-note wandering
- Avoid labeling her simply “futurist”—she resonates more with “social systems cartographer”
- Follow-up questions:  
  • What early signals from the Moon dinner should feed the Beyond Planetary program?  
  • Which unexpected alliances did she observe forming in micro-gravity?
