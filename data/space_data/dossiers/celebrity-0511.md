### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Paul McCartney

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: St. John’s Wood, London; 1,500-acre estate in East Sussex; Manhattan pied-à-terre near Central Park
- Still maintains touring rhythm—6–8 arena dates per quarter—so accustomed to rapid time-zone shifts and novelty environments  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder, bassist & principal songwriter, The Beatles; solo career now past 50 years with 50+ Top-40 hits
- Chairman, MPL Communications (publishing catalog valued ≈ $2.2 B)
- Founder, Linda McCartney Foods (plant-based CPG line, annual sales > $400 M)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing “McCartney Immersive”—mixed-reality concerts using volumetric capture + AI-driven setlists; pilot launch Q4 2026
- Steering a global schools initiative linking music creation to climate action; rollout aligned with COP32
- Personal: expanding regenerative farming pilot on Sussex estate to prove soil-positive plant protein supply chains  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong vegetarian; credits diet for stamina on tour—expects lunar menu curiosity
- Passionate photographer (Leica Q2 always in bag); planning a “Gravity Off” photo series during the event
- Carries a pocket notebook of half-finished lyric fragments; enjoys co-writing impromptu with new acquaintances
- Guiding philosophy: “If we can imagine it, we can play it.” Favours playful brainstorming over formal pitches

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the Dinner Party as a test-bed for immersive performance concepts in extreme contexts—keen to assess acoustics and audience mood in 1/6 g gravity
- Looking to exchange ideas on how sensory tech can deepen emotional connection when people are physically distant (parallels to remote concertgoers)
- Offers cultural gravitas and global reach; a single lunar-strummed acoustic ballad could generate historic PR for Planta and attendees

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: 
  • Hardware designers specializing in haptic feedback suits  
  • Venture leads at Earth-to-Orbit sustainable food logistics firms  
- Attendees can assist by sharing real-time biometric or sentiment data from the dinner—fodder for McCartney Immersive analytics
- Best engagement strategy: invite him to an impromptu jam with whatever instruments survive the trip; he opens up quickly when music starts

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Hearing in right ear slightly diminished—keep background noise moderate during conversation
- Prefers sincere curiosity over Beatlemania trivia; steer toward future-facing collaboration
- Follow-up question aligning with host’s prompt: “What’s one creative skill you practice in total secrecy?” Rumour: he’s privately learning 3-D clay printing for eco-instrument prototypes
