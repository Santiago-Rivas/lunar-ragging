### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Sergey Brin

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Altos Hills, CA; secondary workspace at LTA Research hangar, Moffett Field
- Regular circuits: Zürich (GraphCast AI lab), South Florida for seaplane hours, and Wyoming retreats for off-grid prototyping

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder, Google; former President, Alphabet Inc.
- Founder & CEO, LTA Research — building next-gen electric airships for humanitarian cargo and atmospheric science
- Board-level influence across Google X, Calico, and Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Fast-tracking FAA certification of the 122-m Pathfinder 3 airship; target first UN aid mission Q3 2026
- Quietly funding a lunar-regolith bioprinting startup spun out of NASA Ames
- Personal R&D sprint: AI-powered neuro-proteomics platform to map early Parkinson’s biomarkers
- Spending 10 hrs/week sharpening Mandarin for anticipated greater-China climate collaborations

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Long-time flying trapeze practitioner; still trains twice weekly—cites “voluntary vulnerability” as creativity fuel
- Collects Soviet-era space memorabilia; regards the Lunokhod rover as “the perfect artifact of scrappy elegance”
- Guiding mantra: “You can’t optimize what you haven’t experienced”—drives his hands-on habit of piloting prototypes himself
- Enjoys tasting menus built around fermentation science; keeps a personal koji lab at home

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Moon dinner as a systems thinker testing how micro-societies cohere in extreme environments
- Seeking dialogue on sustainable lunar agriculture and closed-loop oxygen gardens (relevant to Planta’s network sensors)
- Wants candid feedback on LTA’s concept for a stratospheric docking-station network enabling Earth–Moon cargo hops
- Offers deep expertise in autonomous logistics, large-scale data handling, and high-risk capital structuring for off-planet ventures

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions requested: ESA’s life-support lead Dr. Amélie Fouché; JAXA’s Smart Lander instrumentation team
- Could mentor early-stage founders exploring low-g manufacturing or bio-reactor farms
- Best engagement tactic: invite him to tour any backstage control room or sensor array—he prefers technical depth over cocktail chat

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Subtle color-blindness; appreciates high-contrast visuals in presentations
- Rumored to be assembling an invite-only “Zero-G Philanthropy Fund” (initial $500 M) focused on space-for-Earth climate solutions—prime follow-up topic
- Unusual-fact prompt: ask about his custom trapeze rig designed for parabolic-flight maneuvers—few outside his inner circle know it exists
