### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Dylan Field

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: San Francisco, CA
- Secondary anchor in New York for investor meetings; quarterly loops through Tokyo & Reykjavík for design-culture inspiration
- “Stacked travel” habit: strings 2–3 cities per trip, always carrying a collapsible VR rig in hand luggage

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & CEO, Figma — dominant cloud-native design platform (>7 M monthly active creators)
- Steering “Figma Galaxy” expansion: real-time collaboration layer for spatial, AR/VR, and orbital environments
- Angel portfolio: 55 early-stage bets (spatial computing, climate hardware, Type-Safe AI); board observer, Humane Inc.

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Shipping Figma’s “Multiverse” runtime so designers can co-edit 3-D interfaces with <40 ms latency between Earth, LEO, and lunar relays by mid-2026
- Building a 40-person applied-research lab focused on AI-assisted design agents that generate interface states based on spoken direction
- Personal quest: collect a complete first-edition set of Hokusai’s “Thirty-Six Views” prints before his 35th birthday
- Preparing Figma’s first multi-orbit design hackathon aboard Axiom Station Q4 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Tinkers with custom mechanical keyboards; hand-solders switches on red-eye flights (“flow state at 35 k ft”)
- Favorite maxim: “Design is the multiplayer language of ideas.”
- Unusual fact to deploy for CONVERSATION_GOALS: once built a working theremin into a standing desk to force correct posture—starts playing when he slouches
- Deep believer in “open systems win”; pushes for interoperable design tokens across software, hardware, and now habitat architecture

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: spearheading tools enabling cross-planetary collaboration; perfect case study for Planta’s vision of transcending geographic limits
- Seeks dialogue on human factors in 1/6 g: how reduced gravity reshapes interface affordances, kitchen ergonomics, and social rituals around food
- Offers live demo of Figma Galaxy running through lunar relay; can capture attendee brainstorms as an interactive time-capsule for future missions

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: NASA Human Systems Integration, SpaceX Starlink Laser Net ops, and Michelin-star chef Dominique Crenn (for zero-waste culinary UI experiment)
- Attendees can help by stress-testing Multiverse latency via mixed reality headsets during dinner; feedback loops feed the January sprint
- Engage him with rapid-fire “design improv” prompts—he’ll sketch concepts on a holo-canvas in seconds, sparking group creativity

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers spontaneity over scripted panels; suggest an informal walkabout of the hydroponic garden
- Sensitive area: regulatory fatigue post-Adobe merger collapse (2024); avoid dwelling on DOJ case details
- Follow-up inquiry: his criteria for next-gen “design primitives” in extraterrestrial habitats—could anchor a joint white paper with Planta
