### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Tadashi Yanai

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Tokyo, with a weekend residence in Karuizawa  
- Monthly hops to Singapore, New York, and Paris to inspect flagship UNIQLO stores and meet venture partners  
- Keeps a Falcon 7X on standby; first-time lunar traveler, eager to log the “ultimate site visit”  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Chairman, Fast Retailing Co. (UNIQLO, GU, Theory; FY2024 revenue ¥3.1 T)  
- Steering Committee member, World Economic Forum’s Global Alliance for Sustainable Fashion  
- Noted for compressing design-to-store cycles from 6 months to 21 days through data-driven supply chains  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Rolling out “LifeWear 2030” circular-economy program—goal: 50 % of materials fully recycled or bio-engineered by 2030  
- Piloting generative-AI design studio in Shibuya; aims for 1:1 customer-guided apparel launches in 2026  
- Personally curating a museum-quality contemporary art collection for a public gallery adjacent to UNIQLO’s new Ginza HQ  
- Preparing leadership succession: grooming CFO Takeshi Okazaki and daughter Miko for expanded roles; Yanai seeks a more strategic, outward-facing agenda by 2027  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Handicap 9 golfer; credits the sport for his “obsession with marginal gains”  
- Collects large-scale Takashi Murakami pieces; believes fashion and pop art share a responsibility to “democratize joy”  
- Guiding maxim: “Change clothes, change conventional wisdom”  
- Enjoys counterintuitive ideas—last retreat featured a lecture on algae-based protein textiles  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: exploring adaptive garments for low-gravity environments; UNIQLO Lab has prototyped moisture-wicking lunar base layers  
- Seeks dialogue on user experience design in extraterrestrial habitats—how clothing can serve as social interface, haptic feedback, and psychological comfort  
- Offers: scalable manufacturing know-how, capital, and global retail storytelling to amplify the moon dinner’s vision back on Earth  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired:  
  • SpaceX Starship logistics team (supply cadence for garment shipments)  
  • Patagonia’s R&D lead on regenerative fibers (joint lunar test bed)  
- Suggest inviting him to co-host a “zero-gravity fitting room” demo during the event; aligns with his show-don’t-tell style  
- He values brevity: frame asks in concrete KPIs and timelines, avoid jargon  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers iced oolong tea over alcohol; keep a chilled bottle at his seat  
- Sensitive topic: his public stance against fast fashion waste—position lunar apparel as a lab for closed-loop systems  
- Follow-up Qs:  
  1. Timeline for unveiling the Ginza art gallery (potential venue for post-event exhibit)  
  2. Interest level in co-investing in Planta’s mixed-reality social platform
