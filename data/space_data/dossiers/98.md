### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Angeles, CA  
- Maintains pied-à-terre in Manhattan; retreats to a ranch outside Santa Fe for script work and motorcycle testing

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Pre-production on “John Wick: Chapter 0,” an origin miniseries filming Q4 2025 in Tokyo  
- Partnering with NASA Ames & Caltech on low-gravity mobility R&D, leveraging Arch’s torque-vector tech for lunar rovers  
- Final edits on debut novel “The Quiet Between Breaths,” philosophical sci-fi exploring consciousness transfer

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong bass guitarist; sits in unannounced with indie bands under pseudonym “K.C. Reeve”  
- Amateur astrophotographer—owns a custom Arch-built tracking rig; captures deep-sky images during night shoots  
- Guiding maxim: “Stillness reveals more than speed.” Practices Zen archery to reset between filming blocks  
- Enjoys obscure Victorian poetry; can quote Christina Rossetti from memory (good icebreaker)

### ADDITIONAL NOTES

- Sensitive topic: avoids dwelling on personal losses unless he initiates  
- Follow-up question after conversation-goal prompt: ask about his handcrafted katana fittings—few know he engraves tsuba designs himself
