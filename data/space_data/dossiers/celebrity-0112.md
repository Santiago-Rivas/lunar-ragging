### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Mark Ruffalo

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: Manhattan’s West Village loft & 50-acre regenerative farm in Sullivan County, NY  
- Maintains Los Angeles crash pad near Sunset Gower Studios for on-set weeks  
- Predictable circuit: quarterly UN climate sessions (NYC, Bonn, Nairobi) + film festival drops (TIFF, Venice, Sundance)  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Actor–Producer best known for MCU’s Bruce Banner/Hulk; three-time Oscar nominee (Spotlight, Foxcatcher, Poor Things)  
- Founder, Water Defense & co-chair, 100% Clean Energy Coalition; frequent congressional witness on PFAS regulation  
- Executive Producer, “Re-Earth,” an upcoming eight-part Netflix docu-series profiling climate tech founders (premiering Q1 2026)  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Wrapping principal photography on “The Burning Season,” his directorial debut spotlighting Amazonian defenders (post-production thru Dec 2025)  
- Angel portfolio pivoting toward scalable carbon-negative materials and lunar habitat recycling systems (joined Astrolife Seed Fund in March 2025)  
- Personally drafting children’s book on emotional resilience after illness, leveraging his post-tumor experience; manuscript due September 2025  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Compulsive wood-worker: builds custom longboards from storm-felled trees; offers them as wrap gifts to crew  
- Keeps a beehive apiary on the farm—researching low-gravity pollination as side passion for transport to lunar greenhouses  
- Guiding mantra: “Empathy is the most radical form of activism.” Finds common ground through personal storytelling before policy talk  
- Surprising fact: Won the California State drumming championship in high school; still travels with compact practice pad for stress resets  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees lunar dinner as live case study for closed-loop food, water, and waste cycles—directly aligned with his advocacy for regenerative systems on Earth  
- Hopes to meet hardware founders tackling micro-gravity agriculture, recyclable packaging, and psychological wellness in confined habitats  
- Offers: globally recognized voice to amplify breakthroughs, willingness to film a mini-segment of “Re-Earth” on-site, and access to philanthropic capital focused on climate-positive space tech  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired:  
  • Dr. Gwynne Shotwell (SpaceX) on sustainable propellants  
  • Patagonia’s Holdfast Collective re lunar fiber research  
  • Chef Dominique Crenn to ideate carbon-negative fine-dining menus for space  
- Attendees can assist by sharing prototype data on bioregenerative life-support or co-investing in Astrolife’s second fund ($75 M target)  
- Engagement tips: open with craft or music references (woodworking, drumming); schedule a brief VR walkthrough of habitat waste-to-water loop—he prefers experiential demos over slide decks  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Time windows tight: location scouting in Sumatra Jan-Mar 2027; lunar launch window must align with film hiatus  
- Avoid interrupting meals with plastic bottles—he notices and quietly disapproves  
- Follow-up Qs: gauge interest in narrating Planta Network’s post-event documentary; explore joint initiative “BeeSafe”—testing pollinator modules on future lunar missions
