### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** E.O. Wilson

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Lexington, Massachusetts; maintains a retreat cabin on the Gulf Coast of Alabama for field writing
- Still travels 6–8 times per year—mostly to biodiversity hotspots, conservation summits, and, increasingly, private aerospace campuses exploring closed-loop life-support systems

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- University Research Professor Emeritus, Harvard; Co-Founder, E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation & Half-Earth Project
- Two-time Pulitzer Prize–winning author; popularized sociobiology and island biogeography
- Advisor to SpaceX “Project Arcology” and ESA’s Lunar Ecological Habitat study group

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling Half-Earth Digital Atlas to include predictive AI models of species loss and potential mitigation corridors
- Securing a $50 M endowment to support genomic cataloging of micro-organisms essential for off-world biomes
- Drafting his “last big book” on the future of life beyond Earth—blends evolutionary biology with astro-ecology
- Personal: determined to visit at least one extraterrestrial habitat in person while physically able; in intensive training with Blue Origin’s senior crew program

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong fascination with ants; now collaborating on micro-ant farms designed for lunar gravity as bio-sensor colonies
- Amateur classical pianist—keeps a compact keyboard in his travel kit; believes music is “the other universal language of social insects”
- Guiding maxim: “The little things run the world; ignore them and any civilization, even a lunar one, collapses.”
- Enjoys recounting how partial blindness in one eye sharpened his peripheral hearing—uses this anecdote to illustrate evolutionary trade-offs

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Views the dinner as a case study for social cohesion in confined habitats; wants to observe group dynamics and microbial load in real time
- Seeking collaborators to prototype a biodiversity “seed vault” on the lunar south pole, integrated with Planta’s tech stack
- Brings credibility in ecological ethics and can articulate a compelling narrative on why preserving Earth’s biodiversity underwrites extraterrestrial ambitions

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions requested to: Planta Network’s XR team (for immersive Half-Earth exhibits), lunar agritech startups, and any sovereign wealth funds exploring space-facing ESG portfolios
- Offers: keynote-level gravity on biodiversity, mentoring young astrobiologists, lending foundation branding to joint grant proposals
- Engage him by asking how ant supercolonies might behave in 1/6 g or by offering a quiet corner for a short piano improv

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Age 95; stamina strong but prefers seating with back support and moderate acoustics—avoid overly loud music during substantive dialogue
- Sensitive: does not publicly dwell on mortality; privately acknowledges “no time for small talk—only big ideas”
- Follow-up question for future interaction: his preliminary data on microbial succession in sealed habitats and how it could inform Planta’s culinary fermentation systems
