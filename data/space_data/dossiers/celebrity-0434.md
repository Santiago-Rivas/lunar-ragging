### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Devin Oliver

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: Detroit, MI (family & rehearsal studio) and Los Angeles, CA (producer circle & venture meetings)
- High-frequency traveler on the Asia-Pacific festival circuit; slots trans-Pacific flights to coincide with studio sprints in Tokyo and Seoul
- Recently enrolled in Axiom Space’s commercial astronaut orientation—monthly sessions in Houston and Baja for parabolic flight training

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Lead vocalist & creative director, platinum-streaming electronic-rock group I See Stars
- Founder, Lucid Pulse Labs—boutique venture studio financing immersive-audio and volumetric-capture startups (7 seed investments since 2023)
- Co-architect of “Zero-G Live,” the first VR concert series produced entirely in microgravity simulation; fetched 2 M paid views on launch weekend

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing “Stellar Cartography,” a concept album recorded in spatial audio for Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest platforms (Q4 2025 release)
- Negotiating a Series A for Lucid Pulse Labs ($25 M target) to build a cloud-based engine that syncs real-time biometric data with live music cues
- Personal goal: complete FAA commercial spaceflight qualification by mid-2026 to headline a short-form performance on Blue Origin’s New Shepard
- Mentoring two Detroit high-school robotics teams; plans to spin their MIDI-controlled drone swarm into a touring stage effect

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur astrophotographer—carries a modified Sony α7S for deep-sky captures between tour stops
- Practices lucid-dream journaling; claims 70% success rate and mines the imagery for lyric ideas
- Favorite maxim: “If the venue has gravity, the imagination shouldn’t.”
- Hidden talent: Synesthesia—he “sees” chord progressions as shifting neon gradients (unpublicized outside close circle)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Recruited to design the dinner’s ambient soundscape, blending lunar seismic data with live vocal looping
- Seeks: acoustic modeling data of the Sea of Tranquility habitat to test bone-conduction speakers custom-built for low-pressure environments
- Offers: on-the-spot micro-performances that integrate guests’ biometric signals (heart rate, galvanic skin response) into the music in real time

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • Dr. Chiara Rossi (ESA acoustics lead) for resonance mapping  
  • Sandra Kim (Netflix Interactive) for cross-platform distribution of “Zero-G Live”  
  • Plant-biologist Dr. Anil Menon to explore photosynthesis-triggered sound installations
- Guests can assist by sharing sensor APIs, edge-compute resources, or unique lunar datasets he can sonify
- Engagement tip: ask about his Detroit Makerspace project—a passion topic that quickly opens deeper collaboration talk

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers one-on-one exchanges in low-noise corners; partial hearing loss in right ear from early touring days
- Dietary note: strictly plant-based but adventurous with texture—eager to taste any mycelium-based lunar dishes
- Follow-up question for future meetings: gauge interest in co-developing a Planta-branded “social resonance” soundtrack app for lunar residents
