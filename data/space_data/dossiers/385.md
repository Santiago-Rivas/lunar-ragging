### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Alexis Ohanian

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Angeles, CA (family home + Angel City FC activity)
- Secondary presence: Palm Beach, FL (Williams family estate) & NYC (Seven Seven Six HQ)
- Travel rhythm: 2-week swings between LA ↔ NYC; quarterly circuits to European tech hubs and Grand Slam venues

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & General Partner, Seven Seven Six (≈$900 M AUM across two funds; Fund III launch imminent)
- Co-founder & former Executive Chair, Reddit; still owns a significant equity tranche and retains strong informal influence
- Lead investor/board voice in women’s sports (Angel City FC, Los Angeles Golf Club), Web3 social infrastructure (Farcaster, Story Protocol), and “attention-economy” biotech (Neuralink-adjacent startups)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing $450 M Fund III with an explicit “humanity-scale” thesis: climate resilience, frontier habitats, and post-Earth community platforms
- Accelerating 776 Foundation’s Climate Fellowship cohort; targeting lunar regolith-based agriculture concepts for 2026 pilot
- Personal focus: ensuring daughter Olympia’s chess training and co-authoring a father-daughter children’s book on Armenian folklore

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobbies: competitive chess blitz on Lichess, vintage Nintendo cartridge restoration, and rare Armenian brandy tasting
- Guiding principle: “Great communities outlive great products.”
- Unusual fact (conversation gold): built a private ham-radio rig that bounces signals off the Moon—claims it’s his “cheapest space program”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: lifelong community-building evangelist eager to test social dynamics in extreme environments; eyeing lunar events as proof-points for future Reddit-style forums in space
- Seeking: engineers experimenting with sub-second lunar-Earth latency, chefs researching closed-loop food systems, and policy thinkers on governance for off-planet settlements
- Contribution: can syndicate early capital, media exposure (10 M+ social reach), and viral storytelling chops to make the dinner a global cultural moment

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Gateway program leads, JAXA food-tech group, and sovereign wealth funds eyeing space assets (e.g., Mubadala)
- How attendees can help: share prototypes of XR social layers or lunar agriculture demos; invite him to beta-test anything that could entertain a nine-year-old in 1/6 g
- Engagement tips: open with chess analogies or Armenian history; keep slides minimal—he responds to live demos and meme-ready visuals

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers informal dress and first-name basis; leaves events abruptly if conversations feel extractive
- Avoid prolonged tennis talk—over-requested topic; fatherhood or Armenian heritage yield fresher dialogue
- Follow-up questions to explore: interest level in co-founding a Lunar Community DAO; willingness to host an AMA from the Sea of Tranquility after the dinner
