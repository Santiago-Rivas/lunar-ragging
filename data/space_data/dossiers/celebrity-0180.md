### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Megan Rapinoe

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Seattle, WA; secondary residence and production office in Los Angeles
- Regular shuttles to New York for NBC Sports studio work and Washington, D.C. for policy advocacy
- Annual “purpose trips” to Europe and South America scouting women’s-football development programs

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Retired U.S. Women’s National Team co-captain; two World Cups, Olympic Gold, Ballon d’Or Féminin
- Co-founder, TogethXR (immersive sports & social-impact media); Co-founder, “A Touch More” production banner with Sue Bird
- Board advisor, Angel City FC; strategic partner, Nike’s Equality accelerator

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Leading TogethXR’s $35 M Series A to build mixed-reality fan portals ahead of the 2026 Men’s & Women’s World Cups
- Executive-producing “Equal Play,” a Netflix docu-series spotlighting global pay-equity battles (filming through Q4 2025)
- Quietly training with Blue Origin’s civilian-astronaut program—aim: become first professional team-sport athlete to orbit by 2028
- Personal goal: finish Level 2 sommelier certification; launching limited-release natural wine label “Rapinoe Rising” in 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Culinary explorer: obsessed with fermentation science; keeps a travelling sourdough starter named “Abby Yeaster”
- Recreational chess and speed-cubing; claims tactics drills help visualize passing lanes
- Guiding credo: “Visibility creates possibility—if they can see it, they can be it.”
- Intrigued by low-gravity physiology; already sketching rule sets for “lunar five-a-side” to debut on Moon by 2030

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence underscores the social-connectivity theme: translating sports fandom and communal dining into extra-terrestrial contexts
- Eager to brainstorm microgravity sport demos, XR broadcast layers, and how shared meals can drive cultural narratives off-planet
- Looking for collaborators who blend aerospace engineering, experiential design, and social justice storytelling
- Brings global media reach and charismatic stagecraft—ideal for headline-capturing photo ops and post-event content pieces

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: Axiom Space sport-science team; Patagonia’s regenerative-food R&D (for lunar agriculture tie-ins); Global Equality Fund donors seeking high-impact ambassadors
- Attendees can assist by offering hard data on human vestibular adaptation or VR latency solutions in low-gravity streaming
- Engage her through hands-on experiences: invite her to test-kick a prototype “gravity-light” soccer ball during the dinner’s intermission

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers frank, jargon-free dialogue; disdains performative allyship—anchor conversations in concrete action steps
- Publicly confident yet admits a private fear of claustrophobic spacesuits—worth exploring Planta’s “open-visor” design for comfort
- Follow-up: determine if she’ll license TogethXR tech for live mixed-reality feeds from the lunar base, aligning with Planta Network’s platform roadmap
