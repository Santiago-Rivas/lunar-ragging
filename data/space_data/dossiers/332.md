### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Bernard Arnault

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Paris 7ᵉ, France; secondary homes in Saint-Tropez and New York
- Monthly shuttle between Paris, Milan, Hong Kong, and Los Angeles to survey maisons and flagship openings
- Uses a Falcon 7X; insists on visiting new retail concepts in person before launch

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chairman & CEO, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (75+ brands; €86 B revenue 2024)
- Architect of recent acquisitions: Tiffany & Co. (integration complete), and Rome-based jeweler Bvlgari Hotels stake
- Driving force behind “LVMH Métiers d’Art” initiative—securing rare crafts workshops to keep savoir-faire in-house

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Succession choreography: positioning daughter Delphine as Dior figurehead while grooming sons for Wines & Spirits and Digital Experience units
- Launching “Voyage Extrême” program—ultra-luxury experiences in hard-to-reach locales (Antarctica 2026, low-Earth-orbit capsule 2028)
- Intensifying ESG profile: carbon-negative vineyards in Champagne; regenerative leather sourcing for Louis Vuitton
- Personal: expanding his private art collection with next-gen digital installations, preparing a new Fondation Louis Vuitton satellite space in Miami

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate classical pianist; schedules daily 45-minute practice even on tour—Chopin nocturnes are a favorite ice-breaker topic
- Collects post-war abstract art; believes “creativity flourishes where constraints are extreme”—relevant to a lunar habitat
- Intrigued by material sciences that combine aesthetics and function (e.g., basalt fiber textiles, photoluminescent ceramics)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence underscores convergence of luxury, hospitality, and extraterrestrial tourism—LVMH evaluating lunar retail lab for limited-edition objets
- Seeking discussions on:  
  • Proprietary glassware that performs in 1/6 g for Dom Pérignon Lunar Cuvée  
  • Cross-brand immersive storytelling using Planta’s mixed-reality architecture  
  • Investment partnerships for lunar hospitality build-outs (hotel capsules, art pavilions)
- Offers unparalleled savoir-faire in crafting narrative-driven experiences, plus marketing firepower to publicize humanity’s first off-Earth gala

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value introductions:  
  • SpaceX private astronaut liaison (to align launch manifest with LVMH “Voyage Extrême”)  
  • Chef Rasmus Munk (Alchemist) for sensory-science collaboration on space cuisine  
  • MIT Media Lab responsive materials group for luxury garments adapted to lunar environment
- Attendees can assist by sharing data on guest psychographics to tailor micro-collections; tech partners encouraged to propose joint IP structures
- Best engagement tactic: invite him to a quiet walk along the observation dome, discuss how limited gravity could redefine haute couture silhouettes—then segue into the evening’s surprise tasting

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: avoid probing France-EU tax negotiations or LVMH labor disputes—currently delicate
- He values discretion; any press angles must be pre-cleared with his comms chief, Antoine Arnault
- Follow-up Q: gauge interest in commissioning a site-specific art piece made from lunar regolith for Fondation LV annex
