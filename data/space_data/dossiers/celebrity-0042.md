- Co-developing “Space to Read” initiative with NASA: lunar/ISS read-aloud beams to classrooms by 2027
- Personal focus: ensuring Dollywood’s 50th anniversary expansion is carbon-negative; exploring closed-loop food systems akin to Planta’s hydroponic modules

- Morning ritual: handwritten lyrics at 4 a.m.; keeps a travel-sized autoharp for hotel & in-flight composing
- Collects vintage NASA mission patches & signed Mercury-Gemini postcards—she can rattle off every call-sign
- Off-menu hobby: experiments with heirloom Appalachian seeds in micro-aero gardens; fascinated by plant resilience in low gravity
- Guiding maxim: “Figure out who you are and do it on purpose”—expects the same clarity from collaborators
- Enjoys self-deprecating jokes about her wigs; welcomes playful curiosity
