### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Mike Krieger

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: San Francisco Mission District loft converted into a design studio
- Maintains apartment in São Paulo; spends 6–8 weeks each quarter in Brazil mentoring local founders
- Regular hops to New York & London for newsroom partnerships and product-design salons

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & former Chief Product Officer, Instagram (acquired by Facebook 2012)
- Co-founder & CEO, Artifact Labs (AI-driven news discovery app launched 2023; 22 M MAU as of Q1-2025)
- Active angel in user-centric climate tech (Circular Materials, SolarSync) and advisor to MIT Media Lab Social Computing group

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Shipping Artifact 3.0: multimodal “context cards” that blend text, AI-generated explainer visuals, and community annotations
- Building a Trust Layer—on-device ranking algorithm that is auditable by third-party watchdogs
- Exploring spatial-computing interface prototypes for AR/VR & eventual lunar/low-gravity environments
- Personal: completing a pilot’s license and nighttime astrophotography course; aims to capture the first slow-exposure news chronicle from orbit in 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Obsessed with humane notification design; quotes Dieter Rams: “Good design is as little design as possible”
- Weekend projects: roasting single-origin Brazilian coffee, assembling custom mechanical keyboards, and sketching lunar habitat UI concepts in Procreate
- Quiet but competitive chess player (Elo ~1900); believes time-compressed chess fosters sharper product decisions
- Unusual fact ready for the host’s prompt: secretly codes generative art sketches that turn personal biometric data into minimalist posters—has never shown them publicly

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar dinner aligns with his thesis that “next-gen social networks will be born where bandwidth, gravity, and wonder are all scarce”
- Seeking dialogue on: low-latency mesh networks for the Moon base; psychological design cues that keep micro-communities civil in confined habitats
- Brings value: deep expertise in frictionless photo/video sharing, massive-scale social engagement loops, and intuitions on curating collective memories of first-of-their-kind events

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to: SpaceX Starlink Lunar Relay team; ESA’s Human-Robot Interaction group; Michelin-star chefs experimenting with sensory deprivation dining
- Can offer rapid-feedback “design audit” sessions for attendees building consumer apps or immersive experiences
- Engage him by asking for a live demo of his biometric generative art or his concept sketch for a lunar-surface news feed; he responds best to open-ended design challenges over formal pitches

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Tactfully avoid prolonged discussion of the 2018 Facebook departure—he’s cordial but bored of the topic
- Prefers small groups (≤4) and tables where he can see the horizon—motion sickness mitigation
- Potential follow-up: invite him to co-author a white paper on digital moderation frameworks for extraterrestrial settlements
