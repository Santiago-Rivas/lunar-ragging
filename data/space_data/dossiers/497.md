### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur botanist; cultivates Irish heritage apple varieties—often gifts seed cuttings to fellow leaders
- Classical soprano training in youth; still warms up with Mozart arias before keynote speeches (“it steadies the breath and the nerves”)
- Guiding philosophy: “Climate justice is the bridge between the science of urgency and the politics of hope”
- Enjoys discussing Gaelic mythology as allegory for modern stewardship of shared realms—loves the Cú Chulainn tale

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevant because she frames space exploration through justice and stewardship, lending moral gravitas to a lunar gathering
- Seeking dialogue on: a) lunar environmental protocols, b) inclusive access to off-planet resources for Global South innovators, c) leveraging extraterrestrial events to motivate Earth-bound climate action
- Brings diplomatic convening power and ability to translate visionary concepts into policy language consumed by UN agencies and philanthropic capital

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: SpaceX Starshield sustainability lead; JAXA lunar-regolith recycling researchers; Patagonia’s “in-orbit materials” taskforce
- Could mentor early-career space ethicists or climate-tech founders seeking Global South pilot sites
- Engagement tip: ask about her apple-orchard in Mayo or her pocket notebook of “climate stories”—she’ll invariably share a vivid anecdote that opens deeper discussion

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: keen to avoid partisan Irish politics; prefers future-focused framing
- Prefers walking meetings (even simulated low-g strolls) to formal sit-downs; triple-vetted security due to high-profile status
- Follow-up questions: status of Just Transition Index funding consortium; interest level in co-curating lunar ethics charter with Planta Network engineers
- Conversation hook for host’s request (“something surprising”): her hidden talent for step-dancing—she once performed a silent reel backstage at UN climate talks to relieve tension
