### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Kate Raworth

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Oxford, UK (home & teaching at Environmental Change Institute)
- Secondary base: Amsterdam, NL (HQ of Doughnut Economics Action Lab – DEAL)
- Travel rhythm: 2-week bursts to “doughnut pilot” cities (Portland, Melbourne, Bogotá); quarterly Asia-Pacific swing, avoids long trips in consecutive weeks to model low-carbon practice

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-Founder & Director, DEAL – translating Doughnut Economics into city, business & national policy
- Senior Visiting Lecturer, Oxford Smith School of Enterprise & the Environment
- Author: “Doughnut Economics” (2.8 M copies; in 25 languages); UN-Habitat “City Changer” award 2024

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Rolling out the “21-City Regenerative Dashboard” for real-time social-ecological metrics
- Securing a €60 M blended-finance facility to seed circular-economy zones in the Global South
- Editing second book: “From Planetary Boundaries to Regenerative Metabolisms” (due Q3 2026)
- Personal: mastering solar-powered ceramic 3-D printing—eyeing applications for lunar habitats

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend passion: graphic facilitation—she hand-draws every model before it goes digital
- Early career spent trekking & hitch-riding from Dakar to Lagos researching informal markets
- Guiding maxim: “Design to thrive, not just survive.” Believes scarcity narratives cripple imagination
- Loves surprise data visualisations; brings a pocket-sized Möbius strip to spark systems-thinking chats

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to ensure the “first lunar social gathering” integrates planetary boundaries from day one
- Seeking dialogue on closed-loop food, water, and materials cycles—moon as pilot lab for Earth
- Curious about Planta’s immersive tech for empathy-building; wants to test if it drives pro-planetary behaviour
- Can contribute a fast “Lunar Doughnut” framework during dinner, mapping wellbeing vs. resource draw

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intro desired to: 
  • SpaceX Starship life-support engineers (resource loops)  
  • JAXA’s lunar agriculture team  
  • Patagonia’s new Regenerative Finance Fund (potential backing for dashboard expansion)
- Attendees can help by sharing real-time sensor data pipelines or storytelling talent for mass adoption
- Engagement tip: invite her to sketch a concept on the table-top screens—visual co-creation lights her up

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Values authenticity; detect & drop jargon quickly
- Sensitive topic: refuses endorsement deals from fossil-linked sponsors—vet collaborations accordingly
- Follow-up after event: explore co-authoring a “Moon Lessons for Earth Cities” white paper with Planta
