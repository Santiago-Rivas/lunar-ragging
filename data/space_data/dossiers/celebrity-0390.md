### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** John Carmack

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Dallas, TX suburbs; secondary workspace in Austin shared with Keen Technologies staff
- Predictable travel loop: monthly Bay Area trips for compute-vendor meetings; quarterly visits to Boca Chica and Kennedy Space Center to “stay hands-on with propulsion progress”

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Keen Technologies – lean AGI research outfit (20 engineers, $40 M seed from Sam Altman, Nat Friedman, et al.)
- Legendary programmer; co-founded id Software (DOOM, Quake), ex-CTO Oculus VR; inventor on 50+ patents spanning graphics, VR, and aerospace
- Ongoing technical advisor to Meta’s Reality Labs on ultra-low-latency rendering

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Driving a “compute-efficient AGI” roadmap: sparse-matrix training, frugal inference on consumer GPUs, open-sourcing tooling as milestones land
- Fund-raising quietly for a $150 M Series A to secure long-term GPU supply without sacrificing independence
- Re-activating Armadillo Aerospace IP—small methane engine prototypes for agile lunar hopper concepts
- Personal: yearlong “oxygen-deprivation conditioning” regimen; views self-testing as prep for extended lunar or orbital stays

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobbies: night-time high-altitude balloon launches, competitive pistol marksmanship, restoring 1980s arcade boards
- Conversational hooks: deterministic vs. stochastic simulation, classic sci-fi paperbacks (favorite quote: “Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away” – PK Dick)
- Philosophy: “Maximum results with minimum hardware” – obsessively trims code, calories, and conversation fluff

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: veteran VR architect + amateur rocketeer; ideal commentator on human perception and locomotion in reduced gravity
- Seeking candid dialogue on deploying AGI models in off-planet habitats where bandwidth and power are scarce
- Curious to test “lunar presence” prototypes—lightweight headset-based overlays to mitigate horizon illusion disorientation
- Can contribute fast heuristic assessments on life-support redundancies and real-time simulation latency

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: 
  • NASA Gateway Avionics team (for embedded AI inference)  
  • Anduril’s space autonomy group  
  • Deep-tech investors with surplus H100/GH200 allocations
- How attendees can help: share datasets from closed-loop habitat trials; swap GPU hours for access to Keen’s codebase
- Engaging him: launch straight into a technical puzzle or contrarian viewpoint; invite him to inspect a subsystem, not just admire it

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Time-precision: will bail early if agenda slips—keep interactions tightly scoped
- Prefers sparkling water over alcohol; fasting window ends 20:00 UTC—dinner timing matters
- Potential surprise anecdote for “unusual fact” prompt: he quietly wrote a full ray-tracer on a Motorola flip-phone in 2005; never released the code
- Follow-up: gauge openness to becoming Planta’s “chief latency officer” for future lunar-network rollouts
