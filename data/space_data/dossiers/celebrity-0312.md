### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Peter Thiel

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Miami Beach, FL; secondary office hub in San Francisco’s Presidio
- Regular circuit: Washington D.C. (policy dinners), Berlin & London (Founders Fund EU scouting), Queenstown, NZ (citizenship ties & retreat)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder: PayPal, Palantir Technologies; Managing Partner, Founders Fund ($12 B AUM)
- Lead backer behind Anduril, Varda Space, OpenAI seed round; architect of “liberty-tech” investment thesis
- New 2025 initiative: Valar Atlas, a $750 M vehicle focused on frontier defense and off-planet logistics

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Accelerating lunar & cislunar supply-chain startups to pre-position assets for NASA’s Artemis IV window
- Funding rejuvenation biotech; personal aim to “extend productive lifespan to 120 years”
- Quietly building a private institute studying René Girard’s mimetic theory applied to geopolitical risk
- Drafting a contrarian essay series on “post-nation social architecture” for release in late 2025

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Former US Junior Chess champion; still plays 5-minute blitz nightly on Lichess under an alias
- Collects first-edition Tolkien and obscure Cold War cryptography manuals
- Guiding maxim: “Find the hidden monopoly, then make it moral.”
- Surprising tidbit for conversation: writes German-language science-fiction short stories exploring seasteads on Enceladus—unpublished but 80k words deep

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees The First Dinner Party on the Moon as a live prototype for permanent off-Earth social micro-states
- Looking to identify chefs, architects, and behavioral scientists able to “design cultures, not just habitats”
- Will probe guests on how ultra-scarce physical presence alters status games—expects candid, model-breaking answers
- Offers sharp perspective on financing lunar infrastructure and legal frameworks for private governance

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: 
  • senior Artemis program officers open to private resupply tenders  
  • Michelin-star chefs willing to co-found a zero-gravity culinary lab  
  • sovereign wealth funds in the Gulf exploring space industrialization
- Valuable contact he can provide: Founders Fund’s special situations partner who fast-tracks dual-use tech into DoD contracts
- Engagement tip: challenge his ideas with well-sourced contrarian data; he respects rigorous pushback more than deference

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers small, intense exchanges over large receptions; secure a quiet corner or walk-and-talk under simulated lunar night
- Sensitive topic: he’s divesting from certain AI surveillance plays—avoid conflating him with broad “big-data” narratives
- Follow-up questions:  
  1) Status of Valar Atlas’s first space-habitat SPV  
  2) Would he release any of his German sci-fi for Planta’s experiential storytelling modules
