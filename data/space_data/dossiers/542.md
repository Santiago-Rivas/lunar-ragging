### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Xóchitl Guadalupe Cruz López

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico  
- Splits semesters between UNAM (Mexico City) and MIT (Energy & Climate Innovation fellowship)  
- Regular travel circuit: COP climate summits, Latin-American renewable-energy hackathons, Boston–CDMX–Berlin corridor  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Lead Engineer, SolMaya Labs – low-cost solar-thermal devices for off-grid communities; 16-person team, 60 k units deployed across rural Mesoamerica  
- Undergraduate researcher, MIT Space Solar Initiative – prototypes of lightweight heliostat arrays for extraterrestrial habitats  
- Youngest recipient, UNAM Institute of Nuclear Sciences “Reconocimiento Sor Juana” (2018); Forbes LATAM “30 Under 30” (Climate)  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing a modular, origami-fold solar concentrator designed for lunar dust conditions; targeting 2026 Artemis Tech Nursery slot  
- Closing a $4 M seed round (Global Good Foundation leads) to scale Chiapas micro-factory network employing indigenous women  
- Personal: polishing Tzotzil-language STEM curriculum for regional schools; plans first full-length Spanish-language TED talk in Q1 2026  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Avid marimba player; composes pieces inspired by solar flare data sonification  
- Weekend astrophotographer—keeps a growing gallery of “sunrise symmetry” shots from different latitudes  
- Guiding philosophy: “La luz que compartes no se agota” (“The light you share never runs out”)  
- Surprising fact to prompt: At 14 she built a functioning solar water-heater powered glowworm habitat that doubled as a study lamp  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to demonstrate compact solar-thermal tiles that could heat water and greenhouses inside Planta’s lunar base  
- Seeking partners for in-situ materials testing (regolith-coated mirrors, dust-repellent films) and mentorship on export-control compliance  
- Will contribute a short “lunar sunrise” marimba improvisation during the dinner to showcase cultural fusion  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: ESA’s In-Situ Resource Utilization team; JAXA’s Kaguya lunar agriculture unit; Patagonia’s Corporate Impact VC  
- Helpful collaborations: space-rated materials chemists, micro-grant scholars for indigenous education, documentary storytellers capturing youth science journeys  
- Engage her with tactile demos—she loves hands-on rigging; propose a quick co-design sketch session on habitat energy routing  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Age 19 at event; NASA medical clearance already underway, but microgravity bone-density protocol still provisional—avoid carbonated drinks and flag calcium data  
- Prefers intimate, curiosity-driven dialogue; indifferent to titles or hierarchy—lead with mission, not résumé  
- Follow-up areas: confirm shipping timeline for her 3D-printed reflector prototypes; explore potential joint IP framework with Planta if on-site tests succeed
