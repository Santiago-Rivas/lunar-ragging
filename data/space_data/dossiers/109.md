### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Brie Larson

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Angeles (Los Feliz residence with on-site editing suite)
- Secondary creative outpost: London’s Soho for post-production on Europe-based shoots
- Mobility: Quick-turnaround travel to Atlanta & Vancouver for MCU reshoots; keeps 72-hour “go bag” for last-minute festival panels and UN Women engagements

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Actor-producer best known as Captain Marvel; Academy Award winner for “Room”
- Founder, 51 Stars Productions—first-look deal with Apple Studios for boundary-pushing, female-driven narratives
- Board advisor, Girls Who Code; early LP in female-led climate-tech fund, Congruent Ventures II

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Developing limited docu-series “Gravity Sisters” spotlighting overlooked women in aerospace history
- Pre-production on second directing project—a mid-budget sci-fi musical using volumetric capture and real-time Unreal Engine sets
- Personal six-month sprint: training for private sub-orbital flight certification to lend authenticity to space-based roles and content
- Expanding NFT-backed fan-engagement platform that channels 10 % of proceeds into STEM scholarships for under-represented youth

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Switch addict: curates a private “Star-Voyager” Animal Crossing island themed around future off-world colonies
- Weekend astrophotographer—lugs a custom Sony α1 rig to remote deserts; obsessed with capturing the “earthrise” viewpoint
- Guiding ethos: “Radical imagination is a form of activism.” Keeps Octavia Butler quotes taped to her script binder
- Hidden talent: builds hand-wired effects pedals; jam sessions help her map character beats

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Intrigued by Planta’s attempt to fuse social connectivity with extraterrestrial settings—parallels her docu-series vision
- Seeking lunar-surface footage rights or high-fidelity simulation assets for upcoming musical’s dream sequence
- Wants candid stories from space-hab engineers to inform script authenticity; also hopes to taste-test low-gravity gastronomy for possible product-placement tie-ins
- Brings global media spotlight & 9.6 M engaged followers; can generate instant buzz for Planta’s moon-based experiences

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: NASA Artemis media liaison, SpaceX Starlab content team, and Michelin-star chef Hélène Darroze (developing zero-G menu)
- Could mentor emerging VR storytellers in Planta’s network; may host a mini-workshop on actor performance inside motion-capture rigs
- Best engagement tactic: ask about her DIY pedal board or recent desert stargazing trip—opens path to deeper space-narrative talk

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers authenticity over celebrity fawning; quick to disengage if conversation feels transactional
- Sensitive: avoids on-record Marvel plot questions (tight NDA window ends Q3 2026)
- Follow-up questions: status of her pilot license logbook hours; what lunar environmental sounds she imagines for the musical’s opening number—aligns perfectly with Conversation Goal: “What’s something unusual or surprising about you that most people don’t know?”
