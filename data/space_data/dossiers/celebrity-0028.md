- Former NCAA Division I soccer goalkeeper—competitive mindset surfaces in deal-making
- Habitual journaler; swears by morning “brain dump” to unlock episode themes
- Guiding philosophy: “Radical candor creates radical connection”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION

- Avoid off-limits topics: past Barstool legal disputes (contractual gag clauses still active)
- Follow-up areas: status of mental-health docu-series & whether lunar social isolation insights can feature; potential cameo from on-site chef for “edible emotion” episode
