### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Sir David Attenborough

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Richmond, London
- Keeps a modest pied-à-terre in Bristol near BBC Natural History Unit
- Travel rhythm: short-haul European festivals & UN climate summits; avoids long itineraries unless linked to conservation impact—private charter reserved for age-related comfort

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Veteran broadcaster & executive producer for landmark series (Planet Earth, Blue Planet, Our Planet)
- Patron, The Wildscreen Trust; Honorary Fellow, Royal Society
- Credited with catalyzing UK single-use plastics legislation after Blue Planet II exposure

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- In post-production on “Evolution: Life’s Second Chance,” a three-part special framing lunar & Martian habitats as mirrors to primordial Earth
- Advising COP32 hosts on narrative storytelling to galvanize biodiversity finance pledges
- Personal mission: secure permanent endowment for global seed-bank expansion before 100th birthday

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong fascination with amber inclusions; maintains a private micro-museum of 6,000+ specimens—spark for many origin-of-life analogies
- Enjoys baroque recorder music; owns a travel-size tenor recorder and occasionally plays a soft pre-dawn improvisation while on location
- Guiding maxim: “A species’ true wealth lies not in conquest but in co-existence.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the dinner as an opportunity to juxtapose “sterile lunar regolith” with Earth’s exuberance—ideal framing device for upcoming series finale
- Looking to discuss:
  • Closed-loop ecological systems inspired by rainforest nutrient cycles  
  • Storytelling techniques to convert lunar awe into terrestrial stewardship action  
  • Novel VR or haptics that could let schoolchildren “feel” Moon-Earth contrasts
- Brings value: instantly recognizable voice for any post-event multimedia; deep archive of planetary footage for comparative displays

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros requested to:  
  • Planta UX lead (for educational VR collaboration)  
  • Space-agritech firms tackling micro-algae protein loops  
  • Philanthropists interested in joint Lunar–Earth seed-bank narrative
- Attendees can help by offering succinct, data-rich updates on habitat-in-a-can prototypes—he prefers tangible science over high-concept rhetoric
- Engagement tip: open with questions about ancient life trapped in meteorites rather than asking for favorite animal stories—elicits fresh enthusiasm

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Hearing slightly diminished in crowded rooms—position on his left side for clearer dialogue
- Unexpected detail aligning with host’s conversation goal: at age 14 he built a homemade telescope from bicycle parts and jam jars; still retains the lens, which he plans to hand-carry to the lunar surface for a symbolic “first Earth-gaze back”
- Follow-up area: gauge willingness to record a 45-second narrative teaser during low-gravity window—requires pre-event scripting to conserve stamina
