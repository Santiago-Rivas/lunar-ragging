### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Yo-Yo Ma

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Cambridge, Massachusetts; maintains studio loft in New York City
- Touring pattern: “hub-and-spoke” world trips in 10-day windows; routinely adds unpublicized pop-up performances at community centers and national parks
- 2026 travel calendar already blocked for rehearsals at NASA’s Johnson Space Center and acoustic tests at ESA’s ESTEC (Netherlands)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Cellist & cultural strategist; 19-time Grammy winner, Kennedy Center & Polar Music Prize laureate
- Founder, Silkroad Ensemble & Institute; UN Messenger of Peace focused on cultural diplomacy
- Board roles: World Economic Forum Global Council on Culture; advisor, Google Arts & Culture Lab

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Preparing “Harmony 70” anniversary tour (Sept 2025–Dec 2026) featuring AI-augmented compositions co-written with technologist Holly Herndon
- Expanding “Our Common Nature” partnership with the U.S. National Park Service into an international series filmed in UNESCO biosphere reserves
- Personal goal: finalize a lightweight, carbon-fiber travel cello that holds pitch in micro-gravity; prototype #3 ships to him July 2025
- Studying mindfulness-based longevity practices; devotes dawn hours to tai chi and silent walking meditations

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur astrophysicist; tracks pulsar sonification research and converts data streams into cello motifs
- Keeps a “beginner’s mind” journal—records one fresh question after every concert
- Surprising fact: trained in sleight-of-hand coin tricks during conservatory years; uses them to break tension backstage
- Culinary passion: ferments kimchi at home; believes the microbial “music of fermentation” parallels improvisation

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the lunar dinner as a proof-of-concept for extending culture beyond Earth; intends to premiere a 4-minute piece titled “Sea of Tranquility Prelude” using live loop pedals and the carbon-fiber cello
- Looking for collaborators in spatial-audio engineering to optimize resonance inside pressurized habitats
- Hopes to discuss how shared artistic rituals can accelerate psychological adaptation for long-duration space crews
- Offers to record a short sonic logo for Planta’s lunar communications platform

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired: SpaceX life-support acoustics team, MIT Media Lab’s Responsive Environments group, and philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs’ climate-culture fund
- Attendees can assist by sharing insights on lunar dust mitigation for delicate instruments and micro-gravity cargo insurance
- Engaging tactics: invite him to test the dining hall’s acoustic “sweet spot”; present any historical lunar audio clips—he enjoys re-interpreting them on the spot

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Schedule buffer: requires minimum 20 minutes of quiet reflection before performing—coordinate accordingly
- Mild claustrophobia; prefers transparent domes to opaque modules
- Follow-up questions: status of pressurized humidity control (50% ideal) for cello integrity; confirm whether event recording rights include distribution in his Harmony 70 documentary
