### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Chamath Palihapitiya

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Portola Valley, CA with satellite homes in Lake Tahoe (skiing/poker retreats) and Vancouver (family ties)
- Travels on a 4–6 week cadence to New York, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore to court sovereign LPs; 2025 travel pattern shows increased stopovers in Houston and Boca Chica to shadow commercial-space launches

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Social Capital; AUM ≈ $18 B with climate tech, deep-tech, and frontier health as current pillars
- High-profile architect of the 2020–23 SPAC wave (Virgin Galactic, Opendoor, Clover Health) and now repositioning as “patient capital for hard science”
- Co-host, the All-In Podcast (≈3 M weekly listeners) – shapes mainstream tech and policy discourse

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Raising a dedicated $3 B “Frontier Fund IV” with a 20-year horizon, earmarked for lunar resource chains, clean-energy storage, and next-gen life-support systems
- Quietly assembling a venture studio in Baja California to prototype low-gravity food production modules; first algae-protein pilot planned for late-2026
- Personal goal: become one of the first 100 civilian lunar visitors; training with ESA parabolic-flight program to secure medical clearance

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Competitive high-stakes poker player; sees probability theory as core to investment rigor
- Weekend obsession: vintage mechanical chronographs—believes the tactile feel balances his digital life
- Guiding philosophy: “Compounded curiosity beats compounded capital”; quotes Charlie Munger frequently
- Surprising fact he rarely shares: spent two summers as a teenage hospital orderly, shaping his conviction that healthcare incentives are structurally broken

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: evaluating Moon-based hospitality, comms, and sustainable food ecosystems—aligned with Planta’s experiential tech
- Seeks candid discussions on closed-loop life-support economics and lunar REIT structures
- Can contribute deal-structuring expertise, media reach, and a pipeline of Series A/B startups focused on in-situ resource utilization

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to: 
  • NASA Artemis Commercial Innovation team  
  • ispace (Japan) & Blue Origin in-situ resource units  
  • Culinary scientist José Andrés (lunar menu R&D)
- Attendees can help by sharing real data on radiation-shielding materials and micro-gravity agriculture trials
- Engagement tips: open with poker or watchmaking anecdotes, then pivot to “risk stacking” in space ventures; keep exchanges data-rich and contrarian

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers blunt, numbers-first dialogue; disengages when discussions drift to pure vision without unit economics
- Sensitive topic: fatigue over SPAC criticism—frame questions around lessons learned, not past missteps
- Follow-up: gauge his appetite for co-hosting a lunar-edition All-In episode featuring Planta’s founders and select astronauts
