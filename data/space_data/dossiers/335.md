### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Frederick W. “Fred” Smith

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Memphis, Tennessee (still keeps an apartment overlooking the FedEx SuperHub)
- Secondary footholds: Washington, DC (policy), Dubai & Singapore (emerging logistics corridors)
- Travel rhythm: Two-week sprints—alternating domestic board meetings with quick international site inspections; seldom more than 48 hrs in one city

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Chairman Emeritus, FedEx Corp. (>$90 B market cap; 200,000+ vehicles worldwide)
- Executive Chair, Frontier Logistics Ventures—personal family office funding next-gen mobility, hydrogen aviation, and cislunar supply chains
- Decorated U.S. Marine Corps veteran; credited with pioneering real-time package tracking (“the information about the package is as important as the package”)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Backstopping a $350 M series of investments in hydrogen-electric cargo aircraft prototypes; first flight slated Q3 2026
- Advising NASA & FAA on autonomous drone-airspace integration standards
- Incubating “Lunar Last-Mile” concept: modular, pressurized cargo pallets able to dock with multiple lander designs—target demo 2028
- Personal focus: capturing FedEx archival lessons for a leadership memoir (working title: “Next-Day Thinking”) while still visiting the flight simulator twice a month to keep his Citation jet type-rated

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Flies vintage P-51 Mustang at charity airshows; insists the smell of avgas “clears strategic fog”
- Civil-War history buff—owns original dispatches from the Battle of Shiloh
- Guiding philosophy: speed is a service, not a feature
- Enjoys late-night blues piano; surprise fact for small-talk prompt: taught himself boogie-woogie during rehab after Vietnam leg injury

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: decades of end-to-end logistics expertise + active lunar payload R&D fit Planta’s “beyond Earth connectivity” narrative
- Seeking candid input on hospitality-grade cold-chain requirements for off-planet dining (fresh produce, specialty wines)
- Offers: can outline proven frameworks for rapid-scaling distribution networks, mentor founders on regulatory diplomacy, and share hard cost data on inter-modal containerization

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX Starship cargo planning team; Blue Origin’s Blue Logistics group; AstroForge materials-return startup
- Host can connect him with Michelin-star chefs attending—to co-design a “farm-to-moon” supply blueprint
- Ideal engagement: short, metrics-rich dialog over route maps; appreciates annotated napkin sketches more than slide decks
- Follow-through: invite to Planta’s post-event virtual think-tank on lunar agri-logistics (he routinely joins early-morning Zooms)

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Slight hearing loss (combat-related); face him directly in noisy settings
- Dislikes futurist hype ungrounded in unit economics—bring hard numbers
- Potential deep-dive Q’s: (1) status of hydrogen-electric regulatory pathway, (2) lessons from first FedEx night-sort hub applicable to extraterrestrial ports
- Very loyal once rapport is built; a meaningful introduction now often converts into decades-long partnership
