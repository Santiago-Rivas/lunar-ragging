**FULL NAME:** Michelle Alexander

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Columbus, Ohio (faculty residence & research hub)
- Secondary footholds: Oakland, CA (family) and New York City (NYT opinion work)
- Monthly speaking circuit across U.S. universities; bi-annual retreats to rural Maine for writing sprints

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Visiting Professor, Union Theological Seminary; Senior Research Fellow, Ohio State Kirwan Institute
- Founder & Board Chair, NewBridge Justice Lab—think-tank merging data science with abolitionist policy
- Author of “The New Jim Crow” (2.5 M copies sold); 2024 MacArthur Fellow for social impact scholarship

### CURRENT PRIORITIES

- Leading multi-city pilot replacing cash bail with community-led restorative justice circles
- Building an interactive digital archive of formerly incarcerated storytellers in partnership with PBS
- Personal ambition: earn an amateur radio operator license to explore off-planet communication protocols

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend astrophotographer—uses a portable 8-inch Dobsonian telescope; loves framing the Tranquility Base region
- Trains in Zen calligraphy; says the empty space between strokes “reveals as much truth as the ink”
- Quietly mentors first-generation law students; values “radical listening” over debate
- Favorite quote: Ursula K. Le Guin’s “We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending to explore ethical frameworks for lunar governance—preventing carceral mindsets in extraterrestrial settlements
- Seeking dialogue on how immersive tech can humanize distant narratives (e.g., VR tours of Earth-based prisons for off-world audiences)
- Can contribute expertise on inclusive policy design, narrative change, and community-driven conflict resolution

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable introductions: NASA Office of Equity & Inclusion, Starship Civil Engineering team, Omidyar Network’s Emerging Tech Fund
- Needs: XR developers who can adapt her digital archive into interactive lunar exhibitions; philanthropists interested in justice-focused civic tech
- Engage her with substantive questions on dignity-centered design; invite her to preview the lunar base’s conflict-mediation protocols

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Surprising fact to surface: she once completed a month-long solo trek of the Camino de Santiago for contemplative practice—rarely mentions it publicly
- Sensitive area: family members’ privacy—avoid pressuring for personal anecdotes
- Follow-up inquiry: gauge willingness to co-author a post-event op-ed on “Imagining Abolition Beyond Earth” for the New York Times
