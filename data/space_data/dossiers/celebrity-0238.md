### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Simona Halep

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: Constanța, Romania & Dubai, UAE (off-season conditioning hub)
- Regular circuit between Bucharest, Paris (Mouratoglou Academy), and South Florida for biomechanics testing
- Recently began quarterly visits to ESA’s Cologne facility to observe micro-gravity training protocols

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Two-time Grand Slam champion (Roland Garros 2018, Wimbledon 2019); former WTA World No. 1 for 64 weeks
- Founder, SH Performance Lab — boutique program blending data analytics, nutrition, and cognitive coaching for elite and junior athletes
- Equity partner & board advisor, VectraWear (EU-based smart-fabric startup monitoring muscle oxygenation in real time)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Targeting full-tour comeback at 2026 Australian swing after early-2025 exoneration from doping suspension; rehabbing with NASA-inspired plyometric regimens
- Expanding SH Foundation’s “Racquets & Rockets” initiative to integrate STEM-focused tennis clinics across Central/Eastern Europe
- Active diligence on a seed investment in Orbital Athletics, a company prototyping low-gravity sport courts
- Personal focus: mastering Mandarin to broaden Asian sponsorship portfolio ahead of 2027 WTA calendar shift

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate amateur astronomer; owns a custom 10-inch Dobsonian telescope—keeps a travel version on tour
- Surprising hobby: sketches futuristic stadium architecture; dream is to design the first orbital tennis arena
- Guiding philosophy: “Pressure is privilege—adaptation is art.” Frequently references Andre Gide’s line, “Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore.”
- Enjoys cooking traditional Romanian sarmale; experiments with freeze-dry techniques for space-friendly cuisine

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- One of the few global athletes actively studying performance in sub-1g environments—adds credibility to Planta’s “beyond Earth” social thesis
- Seeking conversations with: space habitat designers, neuromuscular researchers, and creative directors exploring sport-as-spectacle in micro-gravity
- Can share insights on psychological resilience, team dynamics under extreme travel, and structuring fan engagement when geography is literally planetary

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Human Physiology Lab, Adidas FutureCraft team, Axiom Space wellness officers, and experiential dining entrepreneur Bompas & Parr (re: lunar cuisine)
- Ways to assist her: access to VR simulation data on lunar movement; potential co-development of a “Lunar Rally” exhibition match tied to Planta’s next activation
- Engagement tips: open with her telescope setup or ask how she keeps footwork sharp without gravity—sparks animated, technical dialogue

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid reopening doping controversy; she prefers to frame 2023-24 as a “forced sabbatical that sharpened purpose”
- Appreciates direct, logistics-ready propositions—arrive with concrete milestones, not abstract hype
- Follow-up queries: status of Mandarin immersion program, interest level in joint scholarship fund for girls in sport+STEM, and whether she’s finalized the prototype for her collapsible lunar tennis racquet
