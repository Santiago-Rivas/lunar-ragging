### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Michelle Yeoh

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: Geneva (with husband Jean Todt) & Los Angeles for studio access  
- Regular circuits: Kuala Lumpur (family/charity work), Beijing–Shanghai (production partners), Paris–Cannes (festival season)  
- Accepts long-haul shoots; known for early acclimation trips to extreme environments (Himalayan climate test for a 2024 docu-series)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Academy Award–winning actor-producer; founder, Mythical Destiny Pictures (focus: Asian futurism & strong female leads)  
- UNDP Goodwill Ambassador; outspoken on sustainability and disaster resilience  
- Credited with normalizing stunt performance by leading actresses; holds honorary doctorates in performing arts & creative technology

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Developing a limited series adaptation of Liu Cixin’s “The Wandering Earth” with Netflix Asia and SpaceX Studios for 2026 release  
- Pre-production on “Silk & Stardust,” a zero-gravity dance film choreographed for lunar/ISS environments—seeking on-orbit rehearsal time late 2025  
- Expanding UNDP “Women in Space Sciences” scholarship, aiming to double Southeast-Asian recipients within 12 months  
- Personal: clocking 400 flight hours towards a private astronaut candidacy; daily VR kendo sessions to refine spatial body awareness

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate tea alchemist—travels with a custom gongfu kit; collects rare oolongs aged in Tibetan cedar caves  
- Philosophy: “Balance is earned, not found.” Attributes career longevity to ritualized discipline (Tai Chi at dawn, gratitude journaling at dusk)  
- Enjoys debating the ethics of AI-generated performers; favors “human-in-the-loop” artistry over full automation

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the event as a live test-bed for emotive storytelling in reduced gravity settings—wants to observe how body language shifts at 1/6 g  
- Seeking insights on lunar habitat acoustics for practical dialogue capture in her upcoming dance film  
- Offers star power and cinematic framing tips to Planta Network’s post-event documentary; willing to film short promo clips on-site  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Ideal intros: Axiom Space training leads, Dassault Systèmes VR engineers, Michelin chemist-chef Jérôme Lacroix (for edible narrative research)  
- Could mentor emerging Asian filmmakers attending; open to cameo roles if a concept aligns with her “cultural bridge” mission  
- Engage her with tactile demos—invite her to help plate a course or run a gravity-responsive tai chi flow for guests

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Surprising fact prompt: her first career choice was ballet historian, not performer; injury at 16 redirected her to martial arts film  
- Prefers being addressed “Michelle,” not “Madam”; appreciates tactical briefings over glossy pitch decks  
- Follow-up query: gauge her interest in co-designing a post-dinner micro-film shot entirely on the lunar surface for charity auction purposes
