### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Robert F. Smith

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Austin, TX hill country estate overlooking Lake Travis  
- Secondary bases: Manhattan pied-à-terre (Vista HQ) & Denver family ranch
- Travel rhythm: Mon-Wed NYC deal flow; Thu-Fri Austin; monthly swing through London, Accra & San Francisco for portfolio boards and philanthropy

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder, Chairman & CEO, Vista Equity Partners ($101 B AUM; enterprise-software focus)
- Notable milestones  
  • Repaid $34 M in student loans for Morehouse ’19 class  
  • Architect behind Vista’s proprietary “V/OS” value-creation playbook, now licensed to sovereign funds  
  • Quietly seeded four Black-led growth funds (cumulative $2.2 B) to widen industry diversity

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing Vista Flagship Fund IX ($30 B target, Q1-2026) with new “mission-critical infrastructure software” sleeve—includes orbital manufacturing & lunar ops logistics solutions
- Building Smith Impact Lab: a $250 M initiative to digitize HBCU research, debuting 2026
- Personal moon-shot: codify a debt-relief algorithm for U.S. public college graduates; pilot launch by mid-2027
- Prepping memoir-meets-playbook “Software for the Soul” (Penguin Random House, late 2026)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Fly-fishing purist; keeps a travel rod in his NY office—offers impromptu lessons to decompress negotiations
- Audiophile: owns one of the largest private collections of vintage Moog synthesizers; believes analog sound “reminds us we’re still human”
- Guiding maxim: “Intellectual curiosity compounds faster than capital.”
- Surprising fact (conversation seed): in college he filed two patents on high-temperature aerospace seals—never publicized

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: assessing off-world enterprise-software needs for life-support, supply-chain traceability & experiential media—Planta’s lunar social layer fits thesis
- Seeking:  
  • Early data on human-factor telemetry inside lunar habitats  
  • Design partners for a “Space V/OS” modular software stack  
- Contribution: can underwrite seed-to-Series B capital and open doors to Vista’s 85-company portfolio for rapid integrations

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Valuable intros: NASA Artemis digital operations lead; Luxembourg Space Resources legal taskforce; A16Z crypto/cloud leads exploring zero-latency comms
- How attendees can help: share real user pain points of living/working in reduced gravity; discuss co-investment lanes in space-adjacent SaaS
- Engagement tips: lead with metrics, not hype; segue into music or fly-fishing for rapport; ask about his childhood Bell Labs visits—prompts vivid storytelling

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Drinks sparingly (rare bourbon), prefers warm ginger tea; schedule any heavy asks before 9 pm
- Avoid political debates on carried-interest tax—topic is tightly lawyered
- Follow-up Q: Would he host an HBCU student cohort to stream the lunar dinner live from Vista’s Austin campus?
