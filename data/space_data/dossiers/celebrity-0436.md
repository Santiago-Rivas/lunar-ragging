### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Diébédo Francis Kéré

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Splits time between Berlin (studio HQ) and Ouagadougou (field office & community lab)
- Monthly shuttle to West Africa for on-site reviews; quarterly circuits through Paris, New York, and Lagos for lectures and donor meetings

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Principal, Kéré Architecture (est. 2005); 45-person practice specializing in climate-positive civic buildings
- 2022 Pritzker Architecture Prize laureate—first African to receive the honor
- Signature achievements: Gando Primary School (Burkina Faso), Serpentine Pavilion 2017 (London), forthcoming Benin National Assembly (Porto-Novo, completion 2026)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Scaling prefabricated, bio-based wall system (“KéréBlocks”) for rapid deployment in Sahel education projects
- Finalizing material research partnership with ESA and TU Munich on sintered-regolith structural modules—gateway to extraterrestrial construction
- Mentoring next-gen African architects through the Kéré Foundation; goal: 100 scholarships by 2028
- Personal: compiling an illustrated book of Sahelian folk tales that informed his design philosophy

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong carpenter—still prototypes furniture in Berlin woodshop at dawn before office hours
- Amateur beekeeper; keeps two hives on studio roof—believes “bees are the original master-builders of ventilated architecture”
- Guiding ethos: “Dignity through shelter—every wall should breathe and teach.”
- Enjoys spontaneous drumming circles; carries a compact djembe on long trips for stress relief

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited as a visionary on sustainable habitats; keen to test how passive-cooling logics translate to lunar conditions
- Hopes to meet space-agri specialists to discuss integrating micro-greenhouses into modular housing shells
- Can contribute design thinking on community-oriented common spaces—critical for mental health in off-Earth settlements
- Will be scouting collaborators for a 2028 Earth-Moon design residency under the Kéré Foundation banner

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions sought to:
  • Planta Network’s XR team (to visualize “KéréBlocks-on-the-Moon” concept)  
  • Private lunar cargo operators for material testing payloads  
  • Philanthropic funds focused on education & climate resilience
- Offer to run a pop-up “Design as Dialogue” workshop with fellow guests—fast, hands-on charrette using regolith simulant bricks
- Engage him over tactile samples or prototypes; he responds best when ideas are physically demonstrated

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers direct, purpose-driven conversation; dislikes overly technical space jargon detached from social impact
- Unusual fact to prompt: ask about his rooftop honey labeled “Architecture Nectar”—he gifts mini jars to collaborators
- Follow-up area: gauge interest in co-authoring a white paper on circular building economies for lunar settlements versus Sahel villages
