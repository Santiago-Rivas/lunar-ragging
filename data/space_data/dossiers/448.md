### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Dr. Guadalupe Hernandez

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Dual base: Barcelona, Spain & Mexico City, Mexico  
- Regular rotation through Houston (NASA food lab) and Tokyo (JAXA partnership) every six weeks

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Nebula Nourish — pioneering closed-loop culinary systems for orbital and lunar habitats  
- Former Head of Gastronomic R&D, elBulli Foundation; earned two Michelin stars at her restaurant “Cenote” (Yucatán)  
- Technical advisor on space agronomy to ESA and the Mexican Space Agency

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing Series B ($45 M) to commercialize 3D-printed mycelium protein with embedded micronutrients tailored for micro-gravity metabolism  
- Building a pilot “flavor memory” protocol with MIT Media Lab, using neurofeedback to reduce homesickness in long-duration crews  
- Personal: drafting book “Beyond Terroir—Cuisine When the Soil Isn’t There” (delivery to publisher Q4 2025) and training for the 2026 World Marathon Challenge (7 marathons, 7 continents, 7 days)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Collects meteorite fragments and refashions them into bespoke serving ware—expects to unveil a zero-gravity tea set at the dinner  
- Amateur astrophotographer; travels with a collapsible 6” refractor to capture deep-sky objects during layovers  
- Guiding maxim: “Flavor is the first language colonists will speak on a new world”  
- Surprising fact she enjoys sharing: won an underground break-dance championship in Monterrey at age 17—still practices windmills to loosen up before high-pressure tastings

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited to design and execute the tasting menu, showcasing hyper-efficient lunar crops and lab-grown heritage maize  
- Seeking dialogue with behavioral scientists on multisensory rituals for group cohesion in extra-terrestrial settings  
- Offers attendees experiential insight into how food can encode cultural identity off-world; ready to prototype collaborative dishes in real time

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to:  
  • Planta Network’s VR social architects (to integrate flavor data into their mixed-reality layers)  
  • Lunar surface logistics teams (for waste-to-nutrient loop pilots)  
  • Sovereign wealth funds exploring climate-resilient food assets  
- Attendees can help by sharing sensory datasets (soundscapes, scent profiles) that influence comfort in confined habitats  
- Best engagement: ask about her “zero-crumb croissant” project—she’ll light up and offer a tasting

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Severe allergy to synthetic saffron analog SA-119—must avoid trace contamination in prep areas  
- Prefers candid, idea-dense exchanges; small talk drains quickly  
- Follow-up probe: status of patent filing on her edible biopolymer cutlery (rumored to degrade into electrolyte drink post-meal)
