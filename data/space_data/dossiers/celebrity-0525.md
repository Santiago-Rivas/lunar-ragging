### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Simone Giertz

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Angeles, CA; maintains a small workshop in Stockholm for summer prototyping “retreats.”
- Predictable annual loop: Feb–Jun filming/build season in LA → Jul–Aug Sweden for R&D and family → Fall on-the-road for speaking, maker fairs, and testing contraptions in extreme environments.

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Inventor-entrepreneur & YouTube creator (3.1 M+ subscribers), famed as the “Queen of Sh*tty Robots” turned serious hardware innovator.
- Founder & CEO, Yetch Industries—micro-studio shipping quirky, functional consumer hardware (Truckla model kits, self-assembling desk organizers, upcoming modular micro-greenhouse).
- Collaborations: NASA JPL (low-gravity tool mock-ups), LEGO build series, Starlink rapid-deployment case study.

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Translating viral prototypes into manufacturable SKUs; first mass-market launch slated for Q4 2025 (kitchen automation kit).
- Deep dive into space-ready maker tools—testing soldering, 3-D printing, and CNC processes under partial-g conditions for a 2026 content series.
- Personal goal: publish illustrated book on “Comfortable Failure” philosophy; manuscript 60 % complete.
- Health & wellness: post-tumor recovery stable; emphasis on sleep optimization and migraine management to sustain high-intensity build cycles.

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobbies: orbital mechanics puzzles, open-water sailing, training a rescue pitbull to respond to voice-activated gadgets.
- Unusual fact to prompt: sketches non-dominant-hand blueprints every Sunday to keep the brain “ambidextrous.”
- Guiding maxim: “If it works every time, you learned nothing.”
- Collects defective industrial warning labels—uses them as design inspiration.

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn by the chance to test human-robot collaboration in 1/6 g; carrying a suitcase-sized “Luna Butler” arm prototype to demo beverage self-service.
- Looking for insights on material off-gassing, regolith abrasion, and user-experience constraints in pressurized habitats.
- Brings high-visibility storytelling capability—her recap video could reach 5 M+ viewers, amplifying Planta’s brand and lunar hospitality narrative.

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions: 
  • SpaceX life-support R&D team (for tool compatibility trials)  
  • Patagonia’s circular-materials lab (sustainable enclosures)  
  • Netflix unscripted originals exec (green-light her limited series “Makers in Space”).
- Attendees can assist by sharing field data on robotics failures in analog moon missions; offering joint prototyping sessions in the habitat workshop area.
- Engagement tips: invite her to improvise a live “bad idea brainstorm” during dinner—she’ll riff, sketch, and magnetize the crowd.

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers direct, sarcasm-friendly banter; skip corporate jargon.
- Avoid opening with “Queen of Sh*tty Robots” label—she’s rebranding toward “Inventor & Test Pilot.”
- Potential follow-up: ask about planned Kickstarter for the fold-flat lunar greenhouse kit and what validation metrics she still needs.
