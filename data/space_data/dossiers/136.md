---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: Rhinebeck, NY (family home) & Greenwich Village, NYC (work base)  
- Maintains LA crash-pad near Paramount for filming blocks; monthly hops to Atlanta for Marvel soundstage pickups  
- Annual summer return to Kansas City area for “Big Slick” charity weekend—deep hometown roots keep him grounded  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Actor-producer best known for Marvel’s “Ant-Man” franchise, “Only Murders in the Building” S4 cameo, and cult-favorite comedies (“Clueless,” “Anchorman”)  
- Co-founder, Aftermath Productions—recently inked first-look deal with Apple TV+ for high-concept sci-fi comedies  
- Co-owner, Samuel’s Sweet Shop (Rhinebeck); low-key investor in Kansas City-based VR studio, PlaNetPlay  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Developing “Shrink Ray,” an interactive mixed-reality series leveraging volumetric capture; in pre-production, seeking lunar/zero-g narrative hooks  
- Quietly training for a 2026 charity marathon—leaning into longevity and men’s health advocacy after turning 60 next year  
- Focused on fatherhood balance; son Jack begins NYU film program this fall—Rudd eager to mentor but not hover  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong Kansas City Chiefs superfan; memorizes obscure 1980s play stats for stress relief  
- Vinyl collector (’70s power pop); travels with a compact turntable—loves spontaneous listening parties  
- Guiding philosophy: “Comedy is an empathy accelerator—if they laugh, the guard drops.”  
- Surprising fact he rarely shares: proficient in close-up card magic (learned on Broadway downtime)  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence adds mainstream charm and a Marvel-scale spotlight to Planta’s lunar narrative  
- Actively seeking story material: wants firsthand sensory details of lunar environment for plausible MR scripting  
- Brings quick improv skills—perfect for live “moon-to-Earth” social content Planta plans to stream  
- Curious to taste chef-engineered low-gravity cuisine; likely to riff on mouthfeel and physics during dinner  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Ideal intros:  
  • Planta XR engineers—potential partnership on “Shrink Ray” lunar episode  
  • NASA’s Human Research Program lead to discuss zero-g physical comedy limits  
  • Venture chefs experimenting with adaptive textures (he’s scouting cameo segments for a food-science doc)  
- Offer him a quick walkthrough of habitat life-support systems; he’ll weave the tech talk into humor, amplifying reach via his 9 M IG followers  
- Engage with a light card trick challenge; segues naturally into his hidden talent and the event’s “uncommon commonalities” theme  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers low-ego conversation—address craft or curiosity before celebrity  
- Politely dodges political discourse; safe lane: sports, family, or weird science  
- Follow-up angle: invite him to record a short Moon-based audio cameo for Big Slick 2027 auction—ties event goodwill to his signature charity without heavy ask
