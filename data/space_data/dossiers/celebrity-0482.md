### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Laurene Powell Jobs

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Palo Alto, CA  
- Secondary presence: Washington, DC & downtown Los Angeles for policy and media work  
- Pattern: Two-week cycles between West Coast innovation hubs and East Coast advocacy meetings; regular retreats to coastal Baja for surfing and quiet planning

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & President, Emerson Collective – impact platform spanning climate tech, education redesign, immigration reform, media, and the arts  
- Majority owner, The Atlantic; backer of Axios, California Sunday, and AR/VR narrative studio Atlas X  
- Board affiliations: XQ Institute (co-chair), College Track (founder), Monumental Sports & Entertainment (minority partner)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Deploying a new $3 B climate-solutions fund with a bias toward carbon-negative materials and regenerative ocean farming  
- Finalizing an immersive journalism lab that merges spatial computing and investigative reporting—prototype slated for late 2026  
- Quietly vetting lunar-resource startups for potential “moonshot philanthropy” portfolio; intrigued by closed-loop life-support systems relevant to Earth food security  
- Personal quest: elevate youth civic engagement ahead of 2026 midterms through short-form, creator-led content partnerships

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Dawn surf sessions & free-diving; credits ocean time for her “systems-thinking” mental resets  
- Keeps a private apiary—believes pollinator stewardship teaches interdependence, a theme she weaves into boardroom strategy  
- Favorite line: “Imagination is a responsibility,” often cited when urging leaders to act beyond quarterly optics  
- Fascination with lunar mythology; collects first-edition sci-fi novels and annotates them with present-day policy parallels

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a live case study for designing equitable, emotionally rich communities in extreme environments  
- Eager to discuss: closed-loop agriculture, ethical governance frameworks for off-world settlements, and new storytelling canvases (zero-G holographics)  
- Offers: philanthropic capital, media amplification, and access to a network of policy shapers who can fast-track standards for extraterrestrial habitation

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to:  
  • Planta’s life-support engineering team (possible grant + Series A bridge)  
  • European Space Agency social-science fellows studying lunar governance  
  • Michelin-level chefs experimenting with cellular agriculture—potential collaboration for Emerson’s food initiative  
- Attendees can help by sharing field data on bioregenerative systems and mixed-reality audience analytics  
- Engagement tip: open with a probing question about the emotional narrative we owe future lunar residents; avoid centering conversation on Apple history

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers intimate, idea-dense exchanges over broad panels; a five-person breakout at the observatory window would resonate  
- Sensitive angle: keeps public distance from partisan labels; frame any policy talk around human dignity rather than party lines  
- Follow-up queries: status of her undisclosed ocean-carbon pilot off Palau and whether she envisions a media bureau on the Moon by 2030
