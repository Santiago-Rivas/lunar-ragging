### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS

- Fascination with Stoic philosophy; favorite quote: “The obstacle is the way” (Marcus Aurelius)
- Unusual talent: sketches manga-style storyboards on his iPad during team flights—only physio and two teammates know

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a symbolic overlap of sport, human aspiration, and lunar-gravity performance science; eager to discuss micro-g athletics experiments

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to: SpaceX R&D team on human performance, Epic Games’ Metaverse sports unit, and UN Youth Envoy for joint education campaigns
- Attendees can assist by offering data on circadian rhythm management in space—crucial for his Gravitas Labs investment thesis
