### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** John B. Goodenough

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Austin, Texas (Professor Emeritus, UT Austin)
- Secondary presence: Cambridge, MA (MIT Materials Lab consulting suite) and Seoul (Samsung Advanced Institute advisory board)
- Travel pattern: Rare long-haul flights; relies on telepresence but committed to a 2026 Starship training cycle to acclimate for lunar gravity

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Nobel Laureate in Chemistry (2019) for seminal work on the lithium-ion battery
- Co-founder & Chief Scientific Advisor, Goodenough Energy Systems (GES) – scaling solid-state “glass” batteries with sodium and lithium variants
- Senior Advisor, U.S. ARPA-E Storage Initiative; 340+ publications, 25 active patents

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Commissioning a pilot line in Austin to produce 500 Wh/kg solid-state pouch cells designed for extreme-temperature lunar environments
- Structuring a $150 M Series A to globalize production while keeping IP partially open-sourced for emerging-market access
- Personal: participating in a Mayo Clinic senolytics study; practicing micro-gravity piano technique for Moon-base recreational sessions

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Plays Bach and Chopin nightly; believes counterpoint “relaxes the prefrontal cortex for problem solving”
- Enjoys debating theological ethics of frontier tech; favorite line: “Science without conscience is the soul’s ruin”
- Collects 17th-century maps—fascinated by how speculative cartography mirrors today’s off-world planning

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: His glass batteries promise two lunar-night power cycles without thermal blankets—directly supporting Planta’s off-Earth hospitality concept
- Seeking dialogue on: regolith-derived sodium supply chains, low-g fire-safety codes for solid electrolytes, and immersive educational content to demystify energy storage
- Can contribute an on-site demo: drop-tests and vacuum-chamber discharge of a 50 Wh prototype cell during the dinner program

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Gateway Power Systems lead; JAXA’s lunar regolith-processing team; Patagonia’s climate-fund for resilient tech
- Attendees can help by sharing data on lunar dust abrasion, closed-loop kitchen waste-to-power concepts, and co-authoring a manifesto on “Ethical Energy for Extraterrestrial Settlements”
- Engagement tips: speak slowly (high-fidelity auditory implants); bring tactile models—he loves hands-on inspection; open with a question about how music shapes memory

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: mild macular degeneration—prefers high-contrast visuals, dark mode tablets
- Unusual fact: translates Latin hymns for a local refugee choir—rarely mentioned publicly
- Follow-up queries: gauge willingness to endow a “Goodenough Moonshot Fellowship” through Planta Network; clarify licensing terms of March 2025 patent batch for external collaborations
