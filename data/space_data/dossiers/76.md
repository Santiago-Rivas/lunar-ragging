### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Maren Morris

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Nashville, TN  
- Secondary creative hub in Austin; maintains crash-pad in Los Angeles for session work  
- Touring pattern: 18–24 global dates per year, trending toward boutique “residency-style” runs instead of long hauls

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Grammy-winning singer-songwriter; 18 B+ streams across country, pop & Americana charts  
- Founder & CEO, Humble Quest Records (independent, artist-centric label launched 2024)  
- Co-founder, The Highwomen super-group; outspoken advocate for gender & LGBTQ+ equity in country music

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Writing & pre-producing concept album “Weightless” (space-inspired, Dolby Atmos native, release Q4 2026)  
- Building an immersive concert product with Epic Games to beam real-time performances into VR social worlds  
- Early investor in RightsUnchained, a blockchain platform for transparent royalty splits  
- Personal: navigating motherhood on tour (son turns 6 this year); developing mental-health toolkit for traveling parents  
- Training with Zero-G Corp. to study vocal performance in microgravity—data to inform lunar set

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Holds a private pilot license; logs weekend hours in a 1979 Piper Cherokee  
- Sci-fi enthusiast—cites Ursula K. Le Guin and “For All Mankind” as creative fuel  
- Collects vintage NASA mission patches & turquoise southwest jewelry  
- Core belief: “Empathy has no altitude limit—art is the pressure suit that keeps us human off-world”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Booked for an acoustic “low-gravity” sunset set inside the Tranquility Dome; debuting a new single written on the flight up  
- Eager to swap notes with acoustic engineers on how lunar habitat architecture shapes reverberation  
- Actively scouting partners to co-produce a VR simulcast of the dinner concert for Earth audiences (goal: 10 M concurrent viewers)  
- Brings cultural cachet and narrative flair to Planta’s vision—her fanbase skews millennial parents, a demographic space tourism firms covet

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: Dolby Labs (spatial audio), SpaceX Starship interiors team (in-flight entertainment), Patagonia’s sustainability leads (carbon-neutral touring)  
- Asks the host for a warm handoff to Lunar Psychological Resilience Project—interested in artist-led outreach  
- Best engagement tactic: ask about her first solo flight or how she keeps her Martin parlor guitar tuned in micro-g; offer genuine curiosity vs. tech-name-dropping

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Recently exited a major-label contract—protective of creative autonomy; avoid “big label comeback” talk  
- Non-negotiable: inclusive language and respect for marginalized communities; she will disengage if vibes skew elitist  
- Quietly researching how lunar dust might affect vocal cords—worth flagging a NASA medical contact  
- Follow-up Q: What does she need to feel grounded post-Moon, and how can Planta capture that narrative for mutual storytelling?
