### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Marc Benioff

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: San Francisco, CA (Salesforce Tower penthouse office)
- Secondary residences: Big Island, HI (ranch + ocean research site) and Paris apartment near Place Vendôme
- Annual circuit: Davos, UN Climate Week NYC, Time100 Summit, Salesforce World Tours on five continents

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chair & CEO, Salesforce (>$250 B market cap; leading AI-driven CRM platform)
- Owner & Co-Chair, TIME Magazine; stewarding its shift to immersive, subscription-first media
- Co-founder, Benioff Ocean Initiative; personal philanthropic giving now tops $2 B

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Embedding generative AI copilots across Salesforce Cloud suite; targeting $10 B in incremental ARR by FY-27
- Quietly scouting acquisitions in spatial computing to merge CRM data with holographic collaboration
- Funding a “Digital Coral” program that uses satellite and lunar observations to predict reef stress
- Personal quest: write a follow-up book to “Trailblazer” on leading organizations beyond Earth—draft title “Galactic Stakeholder Capitalism”

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong Star Wars devotee; keeps a scale model Millennium Falcon on his desk for ideation rituals
- Practices Shinto-influenced forest bathing; credits it for his “20-year crystal-ball clarity” in tech trends
- Favorite maxim: “The business of business is improving the state of the world—even when that world is 384,400 km away.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees lunar dinner as a live case study for next-gen employee communities inside Salesforce’s Experience Cloud
- Eager to discuss: psychological safety in extreme environments, AI-driven sentiment analytics for small crews, and carbon-negative habitat design
- Hopes to recruit co-investors for an “Off-World Humanitarian Fund” (seed target: $150 M) supporting space-based climate science
- Offers in exchange: media spotlight via TIME, access to Salesforce’s 150,000-customer ecosystem, and early-adopter licenses to the new “Lunar Cloud” platform

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros desired: NASA Artemis team leads, SpaceX Starship life-support engineers, Michelin-starred chef Dominique Crenn (for zero-waste dining concepts)
- Attendees can help by sharing nascent research on lunar regolith bioreactors and mental-health telemetry
- Best engagement strategy: present a bold, measurable moonshot; complement with a social-impact angle; keep tech details actionable

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers walking meetings—even in lunar gravity—over seated chats; will propose a quick circuit of the habitat before dinner
- Sensitive point: tires quickly of questions about Salesforce succession; frame inquiries around his “next-chapter legacy” instead
- Follow-up questions worth exploring: Would he endow a “Sea of Tranquility Institute” for ocean-lunar climate symbiosis? What metrics would define success for his Off-World Humanitarian Fund?
