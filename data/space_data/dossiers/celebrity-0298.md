### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** John Collison

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Splits time between South Bay (San Francisco Peninsula) and Dublin; maintains a low-key apartment in New York for Broadway weekends  
- Annual pattern: 6–8 transatlantic hops, 2–3 Asia-Pacific swings, and a personal “fly-cation” where he pilots his own Cirrus SR22 to remote airfields

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & President, Stripe (valuation ≈ $95 B); oversees international expansion and new product incubation  
- Board observer, Frontier Fund (Stripe-led $1 B advance market commitment for carbon removal)  
- Angel portfolio: 40+ early-stage bets across climate tech, fintech infrastructure, and “weird hardware” (e.g., lunar-grade 3-D printing)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Shipping Stripe Atlas 2.0—turn-key compliance stack for founders in 190+ countries, including crypto-native wallets  
- Quietly assembling a “Payments-in-Space” task-force exploring settlement networks for orbital and lunar commerce ahead of 2030 tourism surge  
- Personal quest to earn commercial multi-engine rating; wants to be “right seat” on a suborbital flight within two years  
- Deepening Stripe’s internal culture around sustainability; targeting net-negative operations by 2028

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Self-taught keyboardist; composes synthwave tracks under a pseudonym on SoundCloud—reluctant to reveal handle unless prodded  
- Collects 19th-century mechanical calculators; loves the physicality of early computation  
- Guiding maxim: “Reduce friction, then watch what emerges.” Applies equally to finance, travel, and ideas

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a live test-bed for frictionless cross-planetary transactions—keen to discuss how guests might seamlessly split a bill on the Moon  
- Curious about habitat-grade materials and closed-loop life-support systems; viewfinder for future Frontier investments  
- Brings credibility in scaling trust infrastructures—can articulate why early standards matter before a “Wild West” phase sets in

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Would welcome intro to ESA’s Moonlight consortium and the Astranis lunar relay team  
- Interested in meeting chefs experimenting with zero-gravity gastronomy for potential Stripe Climate storytelling  
- Best engagement tactic: ask about the most challenging runway he’s landed on—unlocks aviation, risk, and product analogies

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid overly polished sales pitches; he tunes out when sensing scripted agendas  
- Subtle icebreaker: mention the lesser-known MIT Museum exhibit on mechanical calculators—guaranteed smile  
- Follow-up intel to gather: status of SpaceX’s planned real-time payment satellite mesh; potential Stripe pilot partnership
