### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Tom Cruise

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary bases: Clearwater, FL (family & Church HQ) and London, UK (preferred filming hub at Longcross Studios)
- Regular shuttle pattern: Los Angeles ⇄ London every 4–6 weeks; quarterly visits to Mojave & Space Coast for flight training and aerospace meetings

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Actor-producer & principal of Cruise/Wagner Productions; global box-office > $11 B
- Catalyst for the modern stunt-performing-actor model; set new insurance standards after HALO jump (2018) and canyon motorcycle BASE jump (2023)
- Ongoing collaboration with NASA & SpaceX on first narrative feature partially shot off-Earth (Dir. Doug Liman; tentative 2026 release)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning post-production wrap; overseeing marketing push aimed at Gen-Z IMAX attendance
- Pre-flight protocol for ISS sequence: 3-day orbital stay + EVA cameo; currently logging 15 hrs/month in T-38 trainer & under-the-hood systems briefings at Johnson Space Center
- Quietly assembling financing for an aviation-focused philanthropic fund granting 1,000 pilot scholarships by 2030
- Personal goal: master conversational Japanese before Tokyo promo tour Q4 2025

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Owns and pilots a P-51 Mustang, Gulfstream IV, and occasional Airbus H125 helicopter; happiest “hands on the stick” at sunrise
- Chess aficionado—travels with custom leather roll-up board; enjoys speed-chess wagers on set
- Guiding principle: “The moment you stop pushing the edge, the edge pushes back.”
- Unusual fact he rarely shares: composes ambient film-score sketches in Logic Pro; keeps a 40-track archive he’s never released

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn by the symbolism: a social frontier mirroring his cinematic space venture—expects to glean sensory details for lunar-sequence storyboarding
- Seeking candid conversations with human-factors experts about motion, fatigue, and appetitive shifts in 1/6 g
- Could contribute storytelling chops to Planta’s post-event docu-short, lending mainstream visibility and potential Oscar-short push

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: former ISS Cmdr. Chris Hadfield (for EVA coaching); chef-astronaut José Andrés (space-food narrative); venture lead at Axiom Space (private module tie-in)
- Attendees can aid by offering first-hand lunar habitat data, unique soundscape captures, and plant-biology anecdotes for immersive set design
- Best engagement tactic: invite him into technical problem-solving—e.g., “Could you help us think through camera angles in reduced gravity?”

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers fast, detail-rich dialogue; greet with a firm “Tom” (never “Mr. Cruise”)
- Avoid subjects: tabloid family matters, litigation history, or religious affiliation
- Follow-up Q for post-event call: Would he license one of his private ambient tracks for Planta’s VR recap experience?
