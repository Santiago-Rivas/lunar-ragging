### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Luis von Ahn

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Pittsburgh, PA (Duolingo HQ)  
- Secondary footholds: New York City for investor relations; Guatemala City quarterly for philanthropic initiatives  
- Known for “work sprints in motion”—frequently codes on long-haul flights, favors red-eyes to maximize overlap with European product teams  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & CEO, Duolingo (NASDAQ: DUOL) – world’s largest language-learning platform, 85 M monthly active users  
- Coinventor of CAPTCHA & reCAPTCHA (acquired by Google)  
- MacArthur “Genius” Fellow; Carnegie Mellon University Professor (on extended leave)  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Steering Duolingo’s Leap initiative: AI-generated, voice-first lessons using on-device LLM compression to reach low-connectivity regions  
- Negotiating Series A spin-out for “DuoKids,” a K-6 literacy app leveraging speech recognition for emerging readers in the Global South  
- Personal goal: push Guatemalan tech ecosystem—building a bilingual developer bootcamp in Antigua by Q3 2026  
- Exploring off-planet latency experiments—how language tutoring adapts when 2-second round-trip delays become the norm  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Obsessive endurance cyclist; designs product roadmaps while riding a Wahoo Kickr before dawn  
- Amateur marimba player—keeps a travel-size MIDI marimba in his carry-on  
- Guiding philosophy: “If 100 M people do micro-work for one minute, we unlock centuries of value” (applies same crowd wisdom to language learning data)  
- Surprising fact he enjoys sharing: he owns every edition of the Guatemalan comic “Minestra de Letras,” credited with sparking his love for puzzles  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Lunar setting aligns with his publicly announced “Education Everywhere” thesis—testing pedagogy in extreme environments  
- Seeking dialogue on linguistics for spacefarers: How will a Mars crew’s dialect drift? Could Duolingo capture and teach it?  
- Interested in sensory-constrained UX—designing lessons when users are in bulky suits or reduced-gravity habitats  
- Brings expertise in mass-scale user engagement and gamification; can advise on keeping future lunar residents socially connected and learning  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to:  
  • SpaceX Starlink education team (low latency pipeline)  
  • ESA psychologists studying communication fatigue on ISS missions  
  • Culinary chemists exploring cross-cultural taste adaptation in microgravity (potential co-branded language packs)  
- Offers mentorship for founders tackling inclusive ed-tech; can open Duolingo’s anonymized learner corpus for joint research  
- Best engagement: present a quirky linguistic puzzle or ask how to teach slang to AI—he responds instantly to intellectual play  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers data-backed claims; soft-sells but rapidly disengages from vague futurism  
- Avoid debate on CAPTCHAs’ role in surveillance—topic feels outdated to him  
- Follow-up question worth posing: “Which Mayan language should be next on Duolingo?” (signals genuine interest in his heritage and platform impact)
