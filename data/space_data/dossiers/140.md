**FULL NAME:** Ken Watanabe

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: central Tokyo penthouse overlooking the Sumida River  
- Secondary base: Los Angeles (Pacific Palisades apartment kept for Hollywood shoots)  
- Travel rhythm: Tokyo ↔ LAX monthly; annual summer stay in Niigata mountains to visit family and recharge; staples on the Cannes, Toronto, and Venice festival circuits  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- International film & stage actor, producer, soon-to-be director  
- Breakout: The Last Samurai (Oscar-nominated); global credits include Inception, Godzilla franchise, Letters from Iwo Jima  
- Broadway: Tony-nominated for The King and I (2015), first Japanese actor to headline a Lincoln Center revival  
- Founder, KenWata Productions—focus on Japanese stories with universal stakes; first animated feature in pre-production with Studio Ghibli veterans  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Preparing directorial debut, “After the Quake,” a Japan-U.S. co-production dramatizing 2011 Tōhoku resilience; targeting late-2026 release  
- Advising NHK on a serialized historical drama about early Japanese astronomy; consulting JAXA for accuracy—sparked fresh fascination with lunar exploration  
- Personal: post-remission health optimization—cold-water therapy & plant-based cycling fuel; learning Spanish for a Chilean mining rescue film slated 2028  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Serious analog photography buff—travels with twin-lens Rolleiflex; intrigued by how lunar light will expose on black-and-white film  
- Cultivates 37 bonsai trees; treats trimming sessions as moving meditation, “every cut reveals the story”  
- Grew up operating excavators on Niigata construction sites—rare skill he jokes “might be handy building moon bases”  
- Guiding creed: “Presence is power; eyes speak before words.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as cultural envoy—keen to explore how storytelling changes when gravity and perspective shift  
- Wants dialogues with immersive-tech teams on broadcasting zero-G theater to oncology wards—linking to his cancer-advocacy work  
- Happy to voice or appear in Planta Network’s post-event documentary; his name could open Japanese sponsorship lanes for future off-Earth gatherings  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions:  
  • Varjo & Magic Leap execs (holographic stagecraft)  
  • SpaceX life-support R&D group (for film scene realism)  
  • Japanese conglomerates—Mitsui, SoftBank Vision Fund—interested in extraterrestrial hospitality ventures  
- Engaging him: greet with respectful “Watanabe-san,” share a cup of Junmai Daiginjo (prefers dry, earthy notes); ask which vintage lens he packed for lunar shots  
- Offer a short private tour of the base’s hydroponic bonsai experiment—tailor-made conversation door  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- English fluent but appreciates slowed cadence when technical; occasional interpreter on standby  
- Avoid dwelling on leukemia; he frames it as closed chapter  
- Probe quietly: Would he cameo-host a virtual tea ceremony in 1/6 g? Could Planta integrate his bonsai lore into the event’s symbolic planting ceremony?
