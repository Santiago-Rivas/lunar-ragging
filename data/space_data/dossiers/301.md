### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Richard Branson

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Necker Island, British Virgin Islands
- Secondary hubs: London for Virgin Group HQ, New Mexico’s Spaceport America for Galactic operations
- Routinely splits weeks between Caribbean, U.S. Southwest, and short, high-energy “pop-in” visits to emerging tech hubs (Dubai, Singapore, Austin)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder, Virgin Group (400+ companies); Executive Chairman, Virgin Galactic & Virgin Voyages
- Key achievements: first commercial spaceplane flight with full crew (2021); scaled Virgin’s portfolio to >$25 B annual revenue; Knighted for services to entrepreneurship and philanthropy

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Accelerating Virgin Galactic’s Delta-class spacecraft to weekly tourist flights by late 2026; targeting break-even at passenger no. 1,000
- Incubating “Virgin Moonshot Hospitality” concept—modular luxury pods for lunar & Mars orbit hotels, seeking aerospace manufacturing partners now
- Championing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initiative aiming for 70 % Virgin Atlantic flights on SAF by 2030
- Personally immersed in ocean conservation: funding autonomous reef-mapping drones; planning record-depth submersible dive with granddaughter to raise climate awareness

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Thrill-seeker ethos: believes “adventure is a business strategy”—expects partners to match boldness
- Keeps a handwritten “ideas diary” on him; invites people to jot one wild idea over breakfast
- Enjoys late-night acoustic jam sessions (guitar & ukulele); carries travel-size uke even on spaceflights
- Surprising fact he likes to reveal: collects vintage kites made by prisoners-of-war, a nod to “freedom through ingenuity”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Presence underscores civilian spaceflight’s role in normalizing lunar experiences
- Hunting for collaborations on immersive hospitality tech (AR dining, zero-g culinary R&D) and closed-loop life-support systems adaptable to cruise ships
- Can offer media magnetism and cross-brand amplification—3.2 M Twitter followers, Virgin’s content studios, and in-flight channels ready to spotlight the dinner party

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: lunar construction firm ICON; Japanese space food lab Space Salt; ESG-focused sovereign funds (e.g., Singapore’s Temasek) for SAF scale-up
- Ways attendees can help: demo low-mass hydroponic systems, share IP on lunar waste-to-resource cycles, explore co-branded “Virgin x Planta” experiential packages
- Engaging tactics: propose a micro-gravity kite experiment on the Moon; ask to scribble a moon-restaurant name in his diary—he’ll remember who encouraged creativity

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers conversational storytelling over slide decks; keep stats minimal, narrative maximal
- Politely avoids deep dives into Virgin Orbit’s 2023 bankruptcy—focus on forward-looking ventures
- Potential follow-up questions: status of his planned reef-to-space conservation documentary; timeline for Virgin Moonshot Hospitality MVP cabin
