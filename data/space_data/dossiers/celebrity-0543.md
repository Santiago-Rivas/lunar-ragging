### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Yuval Noah Harari

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Moshav Mesilat Zion, Israel (quiet countryside retreat near Jerusalem)
- Regular circuits: London, Davos, Silicon Valley, and Singapore for policy forums; maintains a yearly 60-day Vipassana retreat with zero travel or communications

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Historian & futurist; bestselling author of “Sapiens,” “Homo Deus,” “21 Lessons,” with 45 M+ copies sold worldwide
- Co-founder, Sapienship—think-tank & media studio shaping global narratives on AI governance and long-termism
- Advisor to multiple heads of state and the UN High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Drafting fourth major book: “Cosmosapiens” – ethical frameworks for off-Earth societies; manuscript due mid-2026
- Leading Sapienship’s cross-disciplinary taskforce on “algorithmic colonialism,” examining data extraction in space ventures
- Personal mission: broaden Hebrew-language climate action curriculum for Israeli high schools
- Quiet ambition: secure an orbital-library project archiving human cultural heritage on micro-etched nickel plates

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Daily practice: two hours of meditation, one hour horseback riding—keeps him “anchored in bodily reality as ideas drift cosmic”
- Recreational fascination with historical board games; designs home-brew variants to test civilizational collapse scenarios
- Guiding belief: “Stories, not rockets, decide whether humanity thrives among the stars”
- Vegan; enjoys tasting plant-based re-creations of historical dishes (e.g., ancient Roman lentil stew)

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a living thought experiment for post-Earth social rituals—ideal material for “Cosmosapiens” chapter three
- Wants candid dialogue on how private firms intend to govern lunar commons and handle cultural heritage sites (e.g., Apollo footprints)
- Brings value: rapid-fire historical analogies, framing risks/opportunities in memorable narratives; media magnetism can amplify Planta’s vision

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Prime introductions: SpaceX and JAXA ethics liaisons; UNESCO’s Intangible Heritage section; Patagonia’s Earth-to-Orbit sustainability fund
- Could advise attendees crafting mission statements that resonate with broad publics and policymakers
- Engagement tips: ask for his preferred long-lasting moral story for the Moon base library, or his favorite under-discussed medieval technological leap

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: keeps personal life with husband Itzik Yahav strictly off-record; avoid probing family topics
- Prefers unhurried, contemplative pacing—allow silent pauses
- Follow-up questions: status of his orbital-library project funding; views on whether AI avatars should have voting rights in off-world settlements
- “Unusual/surprising” nugget he rarely shares: as a teenager wrote Hebrew space-opera novellas—never published but still on his hard drive; he’ll smile if asked which character he’d invite to the Moon
