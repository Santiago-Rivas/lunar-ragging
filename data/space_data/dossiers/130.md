### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Donald Glover

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Topanga Canyon, Los Angeles; keeps a studio loft in Soho, NYC for spontaneous recording bursts  
- Regular rotation: Atlanta (family ties, creative incubator he funds), Lagos (Afrofuturist music collective), and Tokyo (anime collab in development)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Multihyphenate creator: creator/showrunner (Atlanta, Swarm), Grammy-winning artist (Childish Gambino), Emmy-winning actor and writer  
- Founder, Gilga Inc.—a vertically integrated studio for music, film, and interactive experiences; recent slate includes AI-generated visual albums and Web3-driven fan co-ownership models  
- Executive producer on Disney’s “Lando” series, leveraging equity stake in Lucasfilm merchandising IP

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing “Bando,” a hybrid film-album releasing winter 2025 with spatial-audio and real-time audience remixability  
- Building Gilga’s Moonshot Lab: a cross-disciplinary hub exploring performance art in reduced-gravity environments (early talks with SpaceX for parabolic flight rehearsals)  
- Personal pursuit: obtaining sub-orbital pilot certification; eyes first artist-piloted live set on a Virgin Galactic flight by 2027

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Obsessive about vintage Nintendo chiptune synthesis; collects pre-1985 arcade boards to sample raw sound ROMs  
- Philosophy: “Surprise is the highest form of honesty”—believes creative impact is proportional to discomfort with the familiar  
- Practices silent, device-free sunrise walks; credits routine for lyrical clarity—rarely publicized

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: public face of blending art, tech, and social commentary—ideal ambassador for Planta’s “extra-terrestrial social” narrative  
- Seeking to test Gilga’s gravity-responsive audio engine on the lunar surface; wants engineering feedback and potential co-patent partners  
- Will contribute a 7-minute zero-g vocal performance, improvising with ambient base hum as percussion—unique content for Planta’s post-event docuseries

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intro requests:  
  • Planta’s XR lead for integration of holographic layers into Gilga releases  
  • Chief Nutritional Scientist to discuss lunar-grown botanicals as edible instruments (crisp textures for live foley)  
- Can offer: spot in Gilga’s 2026 “Art of Weightlessness” anthology for select attendees; mentorship slot in his covert ‘Young Tricksters’ fellowship for boundary-pushing creatives  
- Engagement tip: open with off-beat trivia (e.g., lunar acoustic differences) then segue to audience co-creation models

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers conversations standing or walking; dislikes “panel” posture—suggest a brief stroll along observation deck glass tunnel  
- Sensitive topic: keeps family life fiercely private—avoid direct questions about children  
- Follow-up probes: status of his Lagos studio residency program; openness to embedding Planta sensors in next tour’s wearables  
- Possible “unusual” reveal: he storyboarded a never-released Sesame Street episode exploring ennui—keeps sketches on phone for the right audience
