### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Gitanjali Rao

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Split base: Cambridge, MA (MIT undergrad, Materials Science & Engineering) and family home in Highlands Ranch, CO  
- Regular circuits: San Francisco → Denver → New Delhi for youth-innovation workshops; accepts ~12 international speaking invites per year

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Seismic Sensors Inc. – commercializing low-cost nanocarbon devices that detect heavy-metal contamination in water and biofluids
- TIME “Kid of the Year” 2020; MIT Lemelson Prize (2024) for Tethys lead-contamination platform
- Authored “Young Innovator’s Playbook,” adopted by 6 US state STEM curricula

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a $6 M Seed+ round to miniaturize Tethys v3 for space station and disaster-relief applications
- Co-designing NASA-sponsored microgravity experiment (launch mid-2026) to test graphene-based sensors in lunar-analog dust
- Personal stretch goal: earn private pilot license before graduation to bolster credibility in aerospace circles
- Continuing to scale weekly virtual mentorship circles—targeting 100K students globally by Q1 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Competitive classical Indian dancer (Kathak); still practices 4 hrs/week as “moving meditation”
- Collects obsolete lab glassware—keeps a 1901 burette set on dorm desk for inspiration
- Favorite axiom: “Problem-finding is more valuable than problem-solving.”
- Secret talent: can identify any Ben & Jerry’s flavor blindfolded after two spoonfuls

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending to explore how real-time environmental sensing can enhance crew health and culinary safety in lunar habitats
- Seeks partners for in-situ testing of nano-sensor array on the Sea of Tranquility base’s water-recycling loop
- Brings compelling youth-centric narrative that amplifies Planta’s “uncommon commonalities” theme; audience resonance guaranteed

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to:  
  • ESA’s Life Support & Physical Sciences team (Dr. Silvia de Martino)  
  • Chris Sacca’s Lowercarbon Capital for climate-tech follow-on funding  
  • Lunar surface agriculture leads at Aleph Farms
- Attendees can assist by offering micro-gravity lab time, flight manifest space, or data on lunar dust composition
- Engage her with open-ended “why” questions; she responds best to curiosity, not accolades

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers small-group dialogue over large-stage spotlights; schedule a 10-minute pre-dinner walk-through of the habitat sensors to hook her technical curiosity
- Sensitive angle: she’s protective of her family’s privacy—avoid probing about media pressure
- Follow-up probe: ask what unexpected crossover she sees between Kathak rhythm cycles and orbital mechanics (ties directly to conversation goal: uncovering surprising facets)
