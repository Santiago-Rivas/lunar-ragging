### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Miranda Bogen

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Washington, DC; maintains a crash-pad in Brooklyn for quick hops to the New York policy circuit  
- Routinely shuttles between DC–San Francisco–Brussels triangle; keeps an “always packed” carry-on for sudden EU AI Act consultations

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founding Director, Algorithmic Justice Project, Georgetown CSET (launched 2024)  
- Former senior adviser, White House OSTP task force that drafted the “AI Bill of Rights” blueprint  
- Ex-policy lead on Responsible AI at Meta; pioneered the first public-facing model card for large-scale recommendation systems

### KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
- Architected the bipartisan “Fair Algorithms Procurement” clauses now standard in 17 U.S. states  
- 2024 World Economic Forum “Tech Pioneer” for contributions to equitable AI governance  
- Co-authored “Tracing Bias in the Wild,” cited 2,700+ times and adopted as a global audit protocol

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Building a federated network of academic-industry auditors to pressure-test frontier models before release  
- Negotiating seed funding for an open-sourced bias-stimulus dataset specific to multimodal generative AI  
- Personally training for a sub-orbital flight with Blue Origin’s researcher program—aims to experience altered-gravity cognition firsthand

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend ceramicist; fires pieces at extreme heat to study glaze microfractures—parallel to “stress-testing” AI systems  
- Amateur linguist fluent in Ladino; fascinated by how minority languages disappear from large language model outputs  
- Guiding philosophy: “Transparency without usable context is theater.”  
- Secretly maintains a 1990s-era HTML blog where she reviews out-of-print sci-fi novellas

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Invited as the ethics voice ensuring lunar social tech promotes inclusion from day one  
- Wants candid dialogue on cognitive shifts in low gravity and how that may warp human-AI interaction norms  
- Brings a prototype “bias telemetry” patch—wearable sensor that logs physiological reactions to ambient algorithms (could be demoed mid-event)

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Seeks intros to:  
  • Planta’s XR cuisine team (interested in sensory-equitable design)  
  • Lunar infrastructure leads at JAXA re: open data policies for off-world habitats  
  • Any investors backing “audit-as-a-service” SaaS for space tech
- Attendees can assist by sharing edge-case user data from multinational VR deployments  
- Best engagement approach: present a concrete, thorny ethics scenario and invite her to co-design guardrails over dinner

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive point: tired of “AI doom” chatter—prefers solution-oriented framing  
- Surprising fact to prompt (aligns with host goal): she once performed as a teenage escape artist on a touring magic show; still practices micro-lock-picking as a focus exercise  
- Follow-up: gauge her interest in joining Planta’s advisory council on “Human Factors Beyond Earth” before competitors approach
