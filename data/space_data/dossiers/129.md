### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Rachel McAdams

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Toronto, Canada; maintains pied-à-terre in West Village, NYC for Broadway and indie film meetings
- Routinely splits time between Ontario lakeside eco-retreat and Los Angeles during award-season circuits
- Travel pattern: frequent short-haul flights on carbon-offset programs; rarely spends more than 10 consecutive days in one city

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Award-winning actor & producer; Academy Award nominee for “Spotlight,” global recognition from “Mean Girls,” “The Notebook,” “Doctor Strange” franchise
- Founder, Greenlight Stories Inc. – boutique production label dedicated to net-zero film sets and female-led narratives
- UN Environment Programme goodwill supporter; executive board member of Re-Film, a circular economy initiative for set materials

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- In post-production on “Northern Lights,” her first docu-feature as director, tracing Indigenous climate innovation above the Arctic Circle (release Q4 2026)
- Developing limited series adaptation of sci-fi novel “Aurora Rising,” committing to 70 % virtual production to cut emissions
- Personal: finishing instrument rating toward private pilot license; planning to certify on electric-hybrid aircraft once commercially viable
- Actively exploring investment in closed-loop life-support tech for off-planet habitats—sees crossover with zero-waste filmmaking

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate astrophotographer; travels with collapsible 8-inch Dobsonian telescope, prefers lunar limb shadows for framing
- Collects vintage star maps (16th-19th century); cites them as reminders that “our stories are etched against a changing sky”
- Morning ritual: cold-water swim, even on production days—claims it “resets narrative intuition”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Attending as narrative ambassador: keen to document emotional texture of humanity’s first communal meal off Earth
- Seeking dialogue on: sustainable lunar supply chains, immersive storytelling tools in 1/6 g, emotional ergonomics of space hospitality
- Brings value: public-facing platform to broadcast Planta’s vision; seasoned producer able to package event footage into high-impact mini-doc
- Surprising anecdote aligned with conversation goal: secretly flew a Cessna 172 solo over the Mojave to photograph a SpaceX launch trajectory—hasn’t shared publicly

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intro requests: 
  • Blue Origin and Axiom media teams for potential co-production deals  
  • VC funds focused on regenerative materials (e.g., Lowercarbon Capital) for Re-Film expansion  
  • Cognitive scientists studying group dynamics in confined habitats
- Ways others can help: share data on lunar regenerative agriculture trials; offer test-bed access for XR capture rigs
- Engagement tip: invite her to experiment with 360° camera placement during dinner prep—hands-on tech unlocks vibrant storytelling dialogue

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers candid, low-key interactions; allergic to excessive flattery—lead with shared purpose
- Schedule constraint: leaves lunar surface within 18 hrs for Toronto press junket—secure at-event meeting slot early
- Follow-up areas: potential cameo or EP credit for Planta’s forthcoming mixed-reality series; feasibility of on-location cold-water immersion ritual substitute (cryotherapy pod) to maintain her routine
