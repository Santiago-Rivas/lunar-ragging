### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Satya Nadella

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Bellevue, WA (Microsoft HQ); maintains family apartment in Hyderabad for quarterly visits
- Regular circuits: Washington, D.C. (policy), Zurich (ETH quantum lab), and Redmond–Houston shuttle for Azure Space partnership with NASA Johnson

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Executive Chairman & CEO, Microsoft (since 2014); stewarded $3 T market cap milestone in 2024
- Catalyst behind Azure Space, Copilot AI platform, and the $15 B acquisition of SynthLabs (spatial-computing OS) in 2025
- Board member, OpenAI; founding patron, Global Digital Empathy Initiative

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Embedding Copilot agents into off-planet operations—pilot with Axiom’s orbital station kicks off Q4 2025
- Scaling Azure Orbital Cloud to provide low-latency compute for lunar surface missions by 2027
- Personally driving Microsoft’s “Planetary Sustainability Ledger” to track and offset every corporate tonne of carbon by 2030
- Carving weekly time for cricket analytics project with teenage son, Zain II—turning Edge browser telemetry into sports data insights

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong poetry devotee—quotes Ghalib and Seamus Heaney interchangeably; keeps pocket-sized notebook for couplets
- Enjoys tinkering with vintage fountain pens; believes the tactile act of writing tempers AI-induced cognitive overload
- Guiding philosophy: “Empathy scales innovation”; cites Rugby scrum as metaphor for iterative teamwork
- Habit: hosts 6 a.m. “reflection walks” around conference venues—open invitation to thinkers who favor quiet conversation over coffee lines

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Moon dinner aligns with Azure Orbital’s 2027 service launch; wants firsthand insight into latency, UX, and human factors in lunar social settings
- Curious how Planta’s “ambient sentiment mapping” tech might integrate with Microsoft Mesh avatars for deep-space teams
- Seeks dialogue on ethical design of mixed-gravity social networks—avoiding the “Wild West” dynamic early internet faced
- Offers 20+ years’ experience scaling global platforms, plus Microsoft’s developer ecosystem to accelerate Planta pilots

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions valued: 
  • Lunar Outpost COO (for edge-compute payloads)  
  • Chef-scientist Heston Blumenthal (for sensory data collaboration)  
  • Global astropoetics collective (possible XR content pack for Mesh)
- Can open doors to Microsoft for co-marketing or joint developer challenges focused on lunar habitation tech
- Engagement tip: ask about how cricket statistics informed his cloud strategy—sparks animated storytelling

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers agenda-light dinners; expects spontaneous idea exchange, not slide decks
- Sensitive topic: avoids deep dives into antitrust probes during social events
- Follow-up questions worth preparing:  
  1) Desired latency threshold for “presence parity” in lunar comms  
  2) Interest level in co-creating an “Empathy Index” API with Planta’s sentiment engine
