### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Zaila Avant-garde

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Los Angeles (undergrad studies at USC’s Dornslife–Neuroscience/Applied Linguistics dual major)
- Secondary foothold: New Orleans family home; frequent East-Coast hops for keynote circuits
- Annual rhythm: Sep–May campus/LA studios; summers split between NBA off-season training facilities and international literacy camps (Africa & Southeast Asia)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Public figure: 2021 Scripps National Spelling Bee champion & Guinness World-Record basketball phenom (four simultaneous dribble records)
- Founder, “Alphabounce Labs” – social-impact startup mixing kinesthetic learning with VR spelling games; pilot programs in 42 Title-1 schools
- Brand collaborator for Nike “Play Is Brain Fuel” campaign; recurring contributor, National Geographic Kids column on curiosity-driven learning

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a $3 M seed round to expand Alphabounce into multilingual modules and motion-capture analytics
- Research stint with NASA’s Human Performance Lab on cognitive-motor adaptation in microgravity—prepping a 2026 parabolic-flight experiment
- Authoring YA graphic-novel trilogy (“Orbit Letters”) blending spelling puzzles, basketball physics, and space exploration
- Personal quest: perfecting a behind-the-back, blindfolded dribble routine for potential halftime show at 2026 NBA All-Star Game

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Obsession with prime numbers; keeps a pocket notebook of “beautiful primes” encountered in daily life
- Enjoys jazz trumpet jam sessions (“helps me spell in 7/4 time”)
- Guiding mantra: “Play is the shortest path between wonder and mastery.”
- Collects vintage lunar mission patches—claims the Apollo 12 patch has the most “spelling-bee energy”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the dinner as a live sandbox for her microgravity learning theories; intends to test a mini dribble-ball designed for 1/6 g
- Seeking dialogues on cross-sensory education tech, particularly haptic feedback in off-world environments
- Offers energetic stage-moment: can spell attendees’ surnames backward while juggling two basketballs—instant content for Planta’s immersive social feed

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: 
  • JAXA or ESA outreach leads for joint lunar-camp curriculum  
  • XR hardware teams refining fingertip haptics (HaptX, SenseGlove)  
- Potential value to others: youth-centric lens on STEAM storytelling; viral-ready demonstrations that spark media buzz
- Best engagement approach: propose a playful micro-challenge (rapid-fire anagrams, dexterity contest) to unlock her competitive sparkle

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Protect downtime—media requests flood her anytime sports & spelling converge; prefers pre-scheduled micro-interviews
- Curiosity trigger: ask about her unpublished list of “words that feel like zero gravity”  
- Follow-up angles: status of NASA cognitive-motor study; timeline for Alphabounce multilingual rollout
