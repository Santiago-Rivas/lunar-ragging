### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Ilya Sutskever

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Presidio district, San Francisco
- Maintains pied-à-terre in Toronto; quarterly cycles through Tel Aviv & Berlin to stay plugged into non-US AI research circles
- Travel pattern: alternating “deep-work retreats” (unannounced, off-grid) with high-impact conference bursts; moon voyage fits his narrative of “thinking where gravity is optional”

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & Chief Scientist, OpenAI; oversees Superalignment division (≈120 researchers, $600 M annual budget)
- Co-creator of AlexNet; architect behind GPT-4→GPT-5 jump in reasoning fidelity
- Holds 100+ patents in large-scale optimization, sparse expert models, and alignment tooling

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Driving a 24-month roadmap to release an open alignment benchmark suite adopted by OECD nations
- Low-publicity partnership with SpaceX Starshield team to embed edge-AI autonomy in lunar and Martian rovers
- Personally coding a “dream-incubation” language model that synthesizes scientific hypotheses from nighttime EEG data—sees it as the next frontier in human-AI co-creativity
- Personal goal: improve Hebrew poetry translation via generative models; wants to publish a bilingual collection by 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Morning routine: one-hour Vipassana meditation followed by free-climbing sessions (no harness) on indoor walls—he credits this for “structural risk intuition”
- Collects obscure Soviet-era science fiction; believes speculative fiction primes society for transformative tech more effectively than white papers
- Guiding principle: “Intelligence is a physical process; wisdom is a social contract”
- Enjoys improvisational piano; often merges live performance with real-time AI accompaniment

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Logical guest: his AI-driven habitat autonomy work underpins several lunar base subsystems
- Eager to discuss psychological impacts of reduced gravity on creative cognition; wants on-site EEG data from guests to refine models
- Seeks collaborators who can supply high-fidelity plant biomes for closed-loop life support—aligns with Planta’s mission
- Will happily offer “alignment sprint” workshops to any startup experimenting with autonomous systems off-Earth

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: 
  • Dr. Jessica Watkins (NASA geologist) for lunar regolith datasets  
  • Chef-scientist Grant Achatz—interested in sensory AI that pairs food textures with emotional states  
  • Sovereign wealth funds exploring dual-use AI/space investments
- Attendees can assist by sharing anonymized cognitive-performance metrics collected during the lunar stay
- Best engagement: approach with a concrete alignment dilemma; he enjoys impromptu whiteboard sessions—keep markers handy

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers intimate, idea-dense conversations over group panels; schedule a moon-walk side quest if possible
- Sensitive topic: public debates over open-sourcing GPT-5 weights—avoid unless you have a nuanced stance
- Follow-up questions: status of his “dream-incubation” project trials; interest level in funding a joint Planta-OpenAI lunar experiment on plant-AI symbiosis
