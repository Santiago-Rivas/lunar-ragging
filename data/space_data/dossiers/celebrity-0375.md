### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Drew Houston

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: San Francisco; maintains apartment in Boston (near MIT circles) for East-Coast sprints  
- Monthly hops to Tokyo & Singapore—Dropbox Asia-Pac revenue reviews and limited LP meetings  
- Routinely books “work-cation” weeks in quiet mountain towns; prized for deep-work code marathons  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & CEO, Dropbox (NASDAQ: DBX); 700M+ registered users, $2.4B ARR  
- Board Director, Meta Platforms; informal bridge between consumer social and productivity SaaS  
- Angel LP in 30+ seed funds; personal thesis: “tools that compress the distance between imagination and output”  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Rolling out Dropbox AI Workspace—contextual retrieval + gen-AI summarization across files, Slack, Figma by Q3 2025  
- Incubating “Quartz”: on-device encrypted edge cache for lunar/space habitats (Dropbox Skunkworks, 8-person stealth team)  
- Evaluating $250 M expansion of Dropbox Ventures to court frontier-tech founders (space infra, neuro-interfaces)  
- Personal stretch goal: earn multi-engine pilot rating and log a suborbital flight before 2028  
- Philanthropic push: $10 M commitment to Code 2040’s new AI upskilling fellowship for under-represented engineers  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Plays blues guitar nightly; keeps a travel-size Martin in carry-on—easy icebreaker  
- Weekend chess speed-runs on Lichess (handle: “syncbyte”, ~2250 blitz)  
- Guiding belief: “Great products erase complexity so people can stay in flow.” Often cites Paul Graham’s “relentlessly resourceful.”  
- Little-known quirk: collects vintage Tamagotchi—claims they’re the first mass-market “cloud for memories.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevant to lunar dinner as thought leader on friction-less collaboration in bandwidth-constrained environments  
- Searching for partners to pilot “Quartz” edge nodes within off-planet habitats; needs feedback on latency, maintenance, UX  
- Brings expertise in consumer adoption, secure sync, and storytelling around human-centered tech  
- Curious how Planta curates serendipity in micro-gravity settings; intends to compare notes on “ambient presence” design patterns  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros: NASA Artemis logistics team, Starlink laser-backhaul leads, Axiom Space ops chief, Chef-astronaut of ESA (for human-factors testing)  
- Attendees can help by sharing real telemetry gaps or psychological hurdles of prolonged lunar stays  
- Best engagement: ask about earliest product prototypes he scrapped—he loves dissecting failure into actionable wisdom  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid raising recent Dropbox headcount reductions; prefers future-focused dialogue  
- He’s testing a “no-slides” conversational style—welcomes whiteboard sketches over formal decks  
- Follow-up: gauge interest in co-authoring a cross-industry whitepaper on “Delay-Tolerant UX Principles for Space Collaboration”
