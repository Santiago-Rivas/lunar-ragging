### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Dr. Robert “Rob” Jackson

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Pasadena, CA (adjacent to JPL), secondary apartment in Houston near NASA’s Johnson Space Center  
- Routinely shuttles between Los Angeles ⇄ Cape Canaveral (Artemis integrations) and Tokyo (JAXA research partnership)  
- Keeps a 48-hour “go bag” ready for surprise parabolic-flight tests; prides himself on never missing a launch window  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Chief Science & Culture Officer, Orbital Social Inc. – venture-backed studio designing human-centric experiences for lunar habitats  
- Senior Advisor, NASA Artemis Behavioral Health & Habitability Program  
- Key achievements & influence:  
  • Authored the Lunar Habitat Social Protocol adopted by NASA, JAXA, and ESA  
  • TED talk “The Social Life of a Moonbase” surpassed 11 M views; positioned him as the go-to voice on space sociology  
  • Co-developed “LunaTaste,” the low-gravity flavor-enhancement system now tested on ISS food payloads  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Leading a $75 M Series B to scale Orbital Social’s mixed-reality “Cohabitat” modules for 2028 Artemis outpost  
- Drafting his second book, “Gravity of Emotion,” exploring how altered gravity rewires empathy and group dynamics  
- Personal ambition: secure a seat on a 2029 circumlunar tourist flight to collect neuro-cognitive data in transit  
- Short-term: refine the acoustic environment inside planta-based biodomes; aiming for sub-30 dB ambient levels to reduce crew fatigue  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Hobbies: jazz bass (keeps a carbon-fiber travel instrument); competitive freediver certified to 60 m; collector of Meiji-era woodblock prints depicting celestial themes  
- Guiding philosophy: “Design feelings first, hardware second.” Quotes sociologist Erving Goffman as often as rocket specs  
- Surprisingly unknown fact he enjoys sharing: danced as a backstage swing for Janet Jackson’s Velvet Rope Tour while in grad school—still nails the choreography during zero-g flights  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: advising Planta on sensory modulation; his research underpins the dinner’s multimodal flavor architecture  
- Seeking: collaborators in neurogastronomy, XR storytellers who can layer personal memories into shared lunar AR vistas, and chefs willing to prototype umami-forward freeze-dry techniques  
- Brings: rigorous data on psychosocial cohesion in extreme environments, a media halo that can amplify event coverage, and access to NASA flight-qualification channels  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • Emirates Hospitality Innovation VP (potential sponsor for luxury lunar lounge)  
  • Michelin-star chef Gaggan Anand (experimental flavor pairings)  
  • Global Ventures’ Space Tourism Fund (lead Series B syndicate)  
- Ways attendees can help: offer real-world use cases for his “Cohabitat” modules, share biometric feedback devices suitable for fractional-g operation  
- Engaging him: start with the question “Which emotion is hardest to recreate off-Earth?” then segue into music—he lights up discussing the bassline physics of reduced gravity  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Dietary: severe shellfish allergy—ensure allergen-free plating during the tasting course  
- Prefers micro-meetings (<15 min) with a clear ask; follow-ups via Signal, not email  
- Future probe: his stance on open-sourcing parts of the Lunar Habitat Social Protocol—could unlock joint IP opportunities if framed around community stewardship rather than dilution of credit
