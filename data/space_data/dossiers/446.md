### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Fionn Ferreira

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: West Cork, Ireland (family home and prototype workshop)
- Secondary base: Groningen, Netherlands – maintains lab access at alma mater
- Travel cadence: Monthly hops to Berlin & San Francisco for cleantech forums; accepts most invitations that overlap with ocean-advocacy work

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, **Ferroplast** – scaling magnetic ferrofluid systems that extract micro- & nanoplastics from water in <10 minutes
- 2019 Google Science Fair Grand Prize; Forbes “30 Under 30” Europe (2023, Science)
- Patent portfolio licensed to three municipal water utilities; early pilot with ESA’s MELiSSA life-support program

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a $25 M Series A to move from pilot rigs to containerized skids for cruise-ship and island deployment
- R&D sprint: adapting ferrofluid cartridges for zero-gravity water loops (NASA SBIR Phase II decision due August 2025)
- Personal goal: earn a yacht-master certification to conduct microplastic sampling in high-latitude seas summer 2026

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Builds hand-blown glass harmonicas; performs ambient sets at sustainability retreats (“sound makes chemistry memorable”)
- Lifelong astro-skygazer; familiar with lunar regolith composition studies – curious about potential ferromagnetic by-products
- Guiding maxim: “Solve a planetary problem once—then re-solve it for every environment, including the ones we haven’t reached yet.”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Closed-loop water purity is mission-critical for any lunar habitat; his ferrofluid tech is a low-mass candidate
- Seeking candid feedback on microplastic presence in launch packing materials and 3D-printed polymers used off-Earth
- Wants to meet: space architects, habitat life-support engineers, and chefs experimenting with algae-based proteins (sees alignment with his ocean-first ethos)
- Can contribute a live demo using reclaimed lunar simulant dust suspended in water to show particle extraction under reduced gravity

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value introductions: Blue Origin’s Orbital Reef sustenance team; Y​ Combinator’s Planet Tech winter cohort partners
- Ask attendees for insight on additive-manufactured stainless components tolerant to ferrofluid exposure
- Engagement tip: Invite him to improvise a short glass-harmonica piece during the moonrise photo-op—memorable, aligns with event’s creative spirit

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Dislikes “eco-token” gestures—ensure conversations focus on measurable impact metrics
- Surprising angle he seldom shares: at 16 he built a working submersible to map seagrass acoustically; proud of the DIY sonar array
- Follow-up probe: gauge his interest in co-authoring an “off-world waste charter” white paper Planta is drafting for UN COP 32
