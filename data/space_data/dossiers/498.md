### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** May Mahboob

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Dubai International Financial Centre  
- Secondary hubs: Singapore (blockchain innovation hub) & Austin, TX (family office)  
- Predictable circuit: 6-week rotation Dubai → Singapore → US West Coast; adds Riyadh or London when negotiating GCC sovereign co-investment deals  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-Founder & Executive Chair, AstreaX Holdings – vertically integrated space-logistics & lunar resources company spun out of the Emirates Mars Mission supply-chain team  
- Founding Partner, Lumina Alpha Fund – $300 M early-stage vehicle backing deep-tech, bio-manufacturing, and climate resilience; 42 active portfolio companies  
- Former UN-OCHA advisor on humanitarian tech; architected the first blockchain-verified aid-delivery corridor for Rohingya camps (2018)  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing $150 M Series B to commercialize AstreaX’s modular regolith-to-habitat printer; first in-situ demo slated for Artemis IV window (2028)  
- Negotiating joint IP pool with JAXA & Honeybee Robotics around lunar dust mitigation coatings  
- Personal drive: ensuring women from the Global South hold equity in off-world infrastructure projects—targeting a 30 % inclusion threshold in every round  
- Quietly scouting neuro-adaptive interfaces to reduce cognitive fatigue during long-duration missions; intends to seed a venture in Q4 2025  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Trained classical sitarist; believes micro-gravity will birth a “fourth musical dimension”  
- Collects vintage mission patches; quotes Arthur C. Clarke: “The limits of the possible can only be defined by going beyond them into the impossible.”  
- Weekend passion: sub-orbital skydiving simulations at Skydive Dubai; uses biometrics from jumps to model stress-response algorithms for astronauts  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to The First Dinner Party on the Moon as a testbed for AstreaX’s closed-loop life-support sensors (two units embedded in the dining capsule)  
- Seeking candid feedback on the “communal resonance” project—acoustic panels that turn heart-rate variability into ambient soundscapes  
- Eager to meet culinary technologists exploring algae-based umami modulators; wants to integrate them into lunar habitat ration packs  
- Offers: can provide real-time data uplink from her demo sensors for interactive displays during the dinner, plus media amplification via her 2.1 M LinkedIn followers  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • Chef José Andrés (space-ready meal innovation)  
  • NASA Ames Human Factors Lab leads  
  • SoftBank Vision Fund’s new Earth-to-Orbit cluster  
- Ways attendees can assist: swap notes on radiation-hardened IoT, commit to AstreaX equity diversity clause, or beta-test her neuro-interface earbuds  
- Engaging her: reference her Rohingya aid corridor—she lights up discussing dual-use tech for humanitarian & space contexts; propose a collaborative microlab in the dinner dome  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers direct, metrics-first dialogue—she’ll disengage if conversation drifts into speculative philosophy without tangible milestones  
- Under NDA with two Gulf sovereign funds; avoid probing for LP identities on-record  
- Follow-up Q for post-event: gauge her interest in co-hosting a “lunar empathy experiment” livestream with Planta to crowdsource habitat design feedback from schools in Bangladesh and Kenya
