### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Andrew Ng

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Palo Alto, CA  
- Secondary base: Singapore—splits roughly 30% of each quarter mentoring ASEAN AI startups  
- Predictable travel loop: Tokyo → Munich → Boston every 6 weeks for Landing AI pilot deployments in semiconductor fabs  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & CEO, Landing AI; Founder, DeepLearning.AI; Co-founder, Coursera  
- Stanford Adjunct Professor; former Chief Scientist, Baidu  
- Driving force behind “data-centric AI,” credited with shifting industry focus from model complexity to data quality  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing $220 M Series C for Landing AI to scale visual-inspection systems across aerospace and advanced battery manufacturing  
- Launching “Small Data, Big Impact” open curriculum aimed at upskilling 1 M mid-career engineers by 2027  
- Personal moon-shot: incubating an edge-AI chipset that functions in extreme-radiation environments—seeking lunar research partners  
- Privately exploring the intersection of AI and mental-health diagnostics after a family member’s late 2024 PTSD diagnosis  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Weekend classical pianist; practices Bach’s Goldberg Variations to decompress—claims it boosts coding focus  
- Collects rare mechanical watches; fascinated by the harmony of precision engineering and algorithmic time-series predictions  
- Guiding philosophy: “Better data beats bigger models.” Also fond of Alan Kay’s maxim, “The best way to predict the future is to invent it.”  
- Unusual fact (conversation bait): Won Hong Kong’s junior close-up magic competition at 14—still keeps a deck in his bag for ice-breakers  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: Champion of human-machine collaboration; ideal voice on how AI can enhance community-building off-planet  
- Seeking:  
  • Partners with expertise in lunar-grade sensors to validate edge-AI chipset prototypes  
  • Insight into closed-loop food production data to benchmark adaptive vision systems  
- Contribution: Can offer rapid on-site AI prototyping workshops; renowned for translating complex tech into actionable frameworks for non-engineers  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • NASA’s Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative team  
  • Chef-scientists experimenting with autonomous hydroponic farms  
  • Venture arms of Airbus and Toyota exploring off-world manufacturing  
- Attendee assistance: Beta access to novel multispectral data sets for his “small-data” research; advisory roles for mission-critical AI governance  
- Engagement tips: Start with a technical puzzle or magic trick prompt; pivot to concrete use cases—he gravitates toward tangible metrics over blue-sky hype  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Prefers productive debate over speculative AGI discussions—steer clear of philosophical doom scenarios unless data-driven  
- Follow-up Qs:  
  • Status of PTSD diagnostic pilot and potential for anonymized lunar crew mental-health dataset collaboration  
  • Interest level in co-authoring a post-event white paper on “AI Readiness for Extraterrestrial Manufacturing”
