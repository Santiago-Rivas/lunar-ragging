### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Victoria Azarenka

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Boca Raton, Florida; maintains apartment in Monte-Carlo for European swing  
- Predictable travel rhythm: January–October on WTA tour; November-December reserved for off-season conditioning camps in Tenerife or Dubai  
- Always travels with her 8-year-old son Leo for stays longer than two weeks—logistics staff accustomed to family-first accommodations  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Veteran top-10 WTA player; two-time Australian Open champion, Olympic mixed-doubles gold  
- Investor & board advisor, MoveWell Labs (AI-driven injury-prevention wearables)  
- Co-founder, “MindCourts” foundation—provides mental-health coaching grants for junior athletes  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Final push for a third Grand Slam title before planned retirement at end of 2026 season  
- Scaling MoveWell’s algorithm to monitor neuromuscular fatigue in zero-gravity trials (MOU signed with ESA last quarter)  
- Ghostwriting phase of memoir “Point of Impact” with HarperCollins—positioning as playbook for resilient parenting in high-performance arenas  
- Personally exploring certification in somatic breathwork; intends to integrate it into WTA player-council wellness protocols  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Serious vinyl collector—keeps portable turntable on tour; hunts for rare Soviet-era pressings  
- Loves astrophotography; travels with a collapsible 80 mm refractor telescope for night-sky shoots between matches  
- Guiding mantra: “Pressure is a privilege—suffering is optional.”  
- Candid about career lows; believes sharing vulnerability normalizes athlete mental health  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Fascinated by microgravity’s effect on proprioception; wants to swap notes with bio-mechanists attending the dinner  
- Seeking lunar-base data to validate MoveWell’s sensor suite for space-tourism fitness programs  
- Offers star power and social reach (12 M total followers) to amplify Planta’s narrative of “human connection beyond Earth”  
- Unusual-but-true icebreaker she’s ready to drop: fluent in sign language—learned during pandemic to communicate with deaf tennis fans on Instagram Live  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions:  
  • Dr. Mei Ling Tan, NASA Space Bio-cognitive Lab (for microgravity study grant)  
  • Serena Ventures team (co-investor potential in female-led sports tech)  
  • Chef-astronaut José Andrés (lunar nutrition collaboration)  
- Attendees can help by sharing real-time biometric data frameworks or offering beta-tester slots for MoveWell’s space edition  
- Best engagement tactic: invite her to capture a long-exposure lunar-horizon photo—she’ll happily teach the group and tag Planta in the resulting post  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Keep conversations authentic; she detects “networking mode” instantly and disengages  
- Time sensitivity: memoir title still flexible—secure mention could lock in cross-promotion with Planta  
- Follow-up probes: interest level in post-retirement commentary role vs. full-time tech founder; openness to board seat on Planta’s forthcoming Human Performance Lab advisory council
