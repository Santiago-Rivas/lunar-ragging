### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Hope Sandoval

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Silver Lake, Los Angeles
- Secondary hideaway: Remote cabin near Mendocino Coast; occasional long stays in Dublin during recording cycles
- Travel rhythm: Short, low-profile tours; retreats to desert or coastal locations between creative bursts

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Co-founder & vocalist, Mazzy Star; frontwoman, Hope Sandoval & The Warm Inventions
- Catalog streamed 1.3 B+ times; voice featured in over 90 film/TV syncs
- Recent collaborations: Slowdive, The XX, Nicolas Winding Refn (soundtrack work)

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing Mazzy Star 30th-anniversary deluxe reissue with immersive Dolby Atmos mix (Q4 2025)
- Writing a concept EP themed around circadian rhythms in zero-light environments; experimenting with bio-acoustic sensors and modular synths
- Personal: Cultivating a desert greenhouse of night-blooming cacti; studying their potential for carbon capture and lunar habitat micro-gardens

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur astronomer—keeps a vintage Questar telescope and journals lunar mare sketches
- Analog photography devotee; carries a 1970s Hasselblad on tour
- Guiding philosophy: “Silence is the frame that lets sound reveal its real shape.”
- Enjoys late-night chess; prefers whispered strategy discussions over flashy openings

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to the Dinner Party’s exploration of sensory perception in low gravity—testing how reverb behaves in the Sea of Tranquility Dome
- Hopes to source partners for a limited-run “Lunar Lullabies” spatial-audio experience to premiere in 2027
- Curious about Planta’s social-tech layer for asynchronous storytelling; sees potential for fan-generated dream diaries synced to her music
- Can offer an intimate, candle-lit micro-performance using only voice, harmonium, and hydroponic plant resonance sensors—ideal after the main dinner reveal

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introduction desired to: 
  • Planta’s immersive audio lead  
  • ESA botanists testing closed-loop plant systems  
  • Private equity groups funding sustainable touring logistics
- Attendees can help by sharing research on acoustic dampening materials suited for pressurized lunar habitats
- Best engagement approach: invite her to a quiet side vault of the dome, ask about her cactus greenhouse or the “dark silence” track she’s mixing—she’ll open up when the setting feels contemplative

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Private, avoids gossip; dislikes bright camera flashes—ensure any media moments are opt-in
- Surprising fact aligned with host’s prompt: she’s trained to mimic over 40 species of bird calls and uses them to test microphone sensitivity
- Follow-up exploration: gauge her interest in co-creating a Planta-branded vinyl that embeds lunar dust in the press for charity
