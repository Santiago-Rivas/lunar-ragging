### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Dr. Katherine Louise Bouman

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Pasadena, CA (Caltech faculty residence)
- Monthly research rotations at MIT CSAIL and NSF’s South Pole Telescope site
- Frequent fieldwork trips to Atacama Desert (ALMA array) and Hawaii (Submillimeter Array); logs ≈180k air miles per year

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Associate Professor, Computing & Mathematical Sciences, Caltech; leads Visual Imaging Lab
- Key architect of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) algorithms that delivered the first image of a black hole (2019) and subsequent real-time imaging upgrade (2024)
- Co-PI, NASA “Celestial Imaging for Habitable Worlds” initiative—$95 M grant to miniaturize interferometric arrays for lunar and Martian deployment

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing on-site calibration protocols for Lunar Interferometer Pathfinder (LIP)—scheduled to soft-land in late 2026; aims to resolve exoplanet atmospheres at 10× current resolution
- Writing “Seeing the Invisible,” a hybrid technical-memoir slated for early 2027 publication
- Personal: training for Level 2 suborbital medical clearance; wants to personally install LIP’s first sensor in 2027 mission extension
- Mentoring three spin-out founders applying computational imaging to medical diagnostics and planetary geology

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur origami engineer; designs foldable telescopic mirrors inspired by Japanese tessellations
- Philosophy: “Big data is overrated—well-chosen uncertainty is where discovery hides.”
- Enjoys analog film photography; keeps a Leica M6 in her field kit to remind students that constraints sharpen creativity
- Regularly DJs 1990s Britpop sets at Caltech grad mixers—surprisingly deep vinyl collection

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevant as a leading voice on off-Earth sensing—ready to discuss how lunar-based arrays can unlock continuous deep-space observation
- Seeking candid feedback on embedding social-science experiments into science missions (Planta’s community-building tech fascinates her)
- Can contribute a five-minute “lunar light” demonstration: simulating black-hole visibility under low-gravity optics to entertain diners

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm introductions desired to: SpaceX Starship Lunar Ops team (for cargo manifest synergies), Fondation Cartier “Art & Cosmos” curators (book launch exhibit), and chef Grant Achatz (to co-design multisensory outreach dinners)
- Attendees can assist by sharing lessons on human-factor design in extreme habitats—insight she needs for LIP’s crew interface
- Engaging tactic: ask about her origami mirror prototypes; offer a napkin for a quick fold-demo—unlocks her playful side
- Host prompt for CONVERSATION_GOALS: “Katie, what’s one hobby of yours that would surprise your grad students?” (She will reveal the Britpop DJing)

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Avoid broad “woman in STEM” platitudes—she prefers specifics over tokenism
- Sensitive: strong views about open data; wary of corporate exclusivity clauses
- Follow-up questions to explore later: 1) viability of crowd-sourced algorithm challenges for LIP; 2) whether she’ll accept NASA’s offered astronaut-scientist track after book tour
