### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Florence Welch

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: South London townhouse overlooking Peckham Rye Common
- Maintains writing studio in Los Angeles; splits months between the two depending on recording or scoring work
- Recent pattern: quarterly retreats to remote coastal Airbnbs for lyric development; avoids heavy touring until new album cycle launches

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Lead vocalist & principal songwriter, Florence + The Machine (40 M albums sold, 7 Grammy noms)
- Expanding into film/TV composition—scored two scenes for 2024’s Dune: Prophecy series, winning critical notice for choral-meets-ambient experiments
- Founder, “High Tide Arts Collective,” a micro-grant fund that backs emerging poets and costume designers

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Finalizing sixth studio album (working title: “Liminal Tide”) with spatial-audio masters at Abbey Road; intended 2026 release to coincide with Artemis IV mission
- Negotiating partnership with Epic Games to debut a zero-gravity dance experience in Unreal Engine 6
- Personally exploring lunar acoustics research—curious how regolith and low-gravity influence resonance; seeking scientific advisors
- Six-month goal: secure carbon-negative supply chain for all tour merch; looking at algae-based textiles out of Rotterdam

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Night-owl watercolorist; paints dream imagery at 3 a.m. to break writer’s block—happy to show sketchbook if asked
- Collects first-edition Gothic novels; cites “sublime terror” as creative fuel
- Favorite maxim: “Disorder is just choreography we haven’t learned yet”
- Long-time sobriety advocate; prefers herbal teas & non-alcoholic aperitifs

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Drawn to The First Dinner Party on the Moon as a testbed for multisensory performance art—would love to premiere a “lunar lullaby” in 1/6 g gravity
- Seeking conversations with aerospace engineers about designing a crystal-based sound chamber for lunar habitats
- Brings narrative-driven creativity and global fanbase; media buzz inevitable if she previews album concept songs in situ

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired: 
  • NASA Artemis acoustics team  
  • Bose Spatial R&D lead (Dr. Linh Q. Tran)  
  • Chef-artist José Andrés for edible sound experiments
- Offer to collaborate on Planta’s social-connectivity demo: live-looping heartbeat sensors from all attendees into a collective soundtrack
- Engage her by asking about the hidden link between Mary Shelley and sci-fi spaceflight—her current research rabbit hole

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Allergic to synthetic fragrances; confirm venue’s air filtration & scent policies
- Prefers small, candle-lit side tables to grand stages for impromptu performances
- Follow-up Q: Would she license unreleased track stems for Planta’s interactive audio wall?
