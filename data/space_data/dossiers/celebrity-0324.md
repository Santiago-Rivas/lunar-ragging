- Guiding philosophy: “Markets have moods; societies need guardrails.” (He often cites Popper but now blends systems neuroscience metaphors)  
- Little-known fact: runs a remote astro-photography rig in Chile’s Atacama Desert—has catalogued over 40 near-Earth objects personally

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees lunar gathering as test-bed for principles of open societies beyond Earth—keen to discuss governance charters for multi-national lunar habitats  
- Looking for visionary founders aligning space exploration with climate resilience (closed-loop life-support, regolith-based CO₂ capture)  
- Offers unparalleled experience in structuring blended finance vehicles; could seed a “Lunar Commons Fund” to ensure inclusive access to off-world resources

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros:  
  • NASA’s Office of Technology Partnerships (for lunar commons dialogue)  
  • Helen Liang, Green Frontier Ventures (co-investor in carbon-negative materials)  
  • Dr. Ye Jun, Chinese Academy of Sciences (quantum-secure comms for democratic elections)  
- Attendees can help by sharing prototypes or policy drafts on lunar self-governance; he prefers concise executive summaries followed by Socratic Q&A  
- Engaging approach: open with a question on his asteroid photography or ask how Popper’s “open society” adapts to a vacuum environment

- Sensitive: wary of protests over past currency trades; keep security discreet but vigilant  
- Follow-up queries: interest level in joining advisory board of Planta’s “Meta-Community Platform”; threshold investment size for Lunar Commons Fund  
- Surprising opener aligned with conversation goal: mention his Atacama telescope discovery of an asteroid now unofficially nicknamed “Open Sky 1”—few outside his inner circle know this.
