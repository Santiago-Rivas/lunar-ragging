### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Juan Esteban Aristizábal Vásquez (“Juanes”)

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residences: Miami, FL & Medellín, Colombia  
- Constant tour loop through Madrid–Los Angeles–Mexico City; slots 8–10 days every month for social-impact site visits in Latin America  
- Tends to book red-eye flights so daylight hours remain free for studio or philanthropic work

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Latin rock icon; founder & CEO, JEP Music Group and Mi Sangre Foundation  
- 27 Latin Grammys, 3 Grammy Awards; 50+ M records sold worldwide  
- Early investor/advisor in spatial-audio platform WaveXR and eco-touring startup GreenerStage

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Wrapping “Lunas de Agua” concept album: Andean folk + AI-generated lunar sound samples (Q4 2026 release)  
- Designing a carbon-negative 2027 world tour powered by modular solar rigs and algae bio-fuel buses  
- Building a $25 M micro-fund to back Latinx founders in music-tech, mental-health, and climate resilience  
- Scaling Mi Sangre’s trauma-informed music therapy curriculum to 200 schools across conflict zones in Colombia  
- Personal goal: earn sub-orbital flight certification before his 54th birthday (August 2026)

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Amateur astrophotographer; keeps a custom Takahashi refractor in Medellín rooftop observatory  
- Vegetarian gourmand; experiments with arepas made from cricket flour—claims “it’s the future protein”  
- Collector of vintage FARC-era peace posters; views art as “evidence that hope outlives violence”  
- Favorite quote: “Music is a spaceship for emotions—gravity should never hold it down.”  
- Secret downtime skill: charcoal sketches of lunar craters, signed under pseudonym “E. Vasquez”

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Aligns perfectly with event’s fusion of culture, tech, and bold social imagination  
- Eager to test zero-gravity acoustics for a short, live acoustic set during the dinner’s transition from Earth-normal to lunar-low gravity simulation  
- Wants to meet researchers on mental well-being in isolated environments to adapt Mi Sangre methods for future off-world crews  
- Can contribute a bespoke anthem and VR-enabled “holographic encore” for remote audiences on Earth

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA acoustics lab (Dr. Tara Lin), ESA astronaut psychologist Dr. Léon Dubois, and SpaceX Starlink broadcast licensing lead  
- Attendees could co-invest in his creative-tech micro-fund or pilot new bio-fuel logistics via GreenerStage  
- Best engagement: ask about his latest telescope upgrade or request a quick strum of the custom carbon-fiber guitar he’s bringing (weighs <1 kg—built for lunar gravity)

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers candid, purpose-driven dialogue; disengages when discussions turn purely commercial  
- Politically vocal on Colombian peace accords—avoid polarizing sub-topics unless well-informed  
- Follow-up: confirm rights and technical feasibility to livestream his lunar performance to Latin American public broadcasters  
- Small but memorable ask: he enjoys receiving locally sourced cacao nibs; makes his own post-show energy bars
