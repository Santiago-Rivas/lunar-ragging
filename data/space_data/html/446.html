  <p>Fionn Ferreira is an Irish innovator and environmental scientist known for his pioneering work in developing sustainable methods for removing microplastics from water. Born in Clonmel, Ireland, Ferreira gained international recognition after winning the 2019 Google Science Fair with his project focused on using magnetic and optical techniques to filter pollutants from aquatic environments. His work aims to combat plastic pollution and promote renewable water treatment technologies for a healthier planet.</p>
  
  <h2>Early life and education</h2>
  <p>Growing up in Clonmel, Ferreira showed an early interest in science and environmental issues. He pursued his secondary education at a local school before enrolling at University College Cork, where he focused on environmental science and engineering. During his studies, he conducted extensive research on microplastic pollution, leading to his innovative approach that earned global attention and awards.</p>
  
  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>Ferreira's breakthrough came in 2018 when he developed a technique employing the use of ferrofluids and light absorption to selectively attract and extract microplastics from water samples. The project was awarded first place at the Google Science Fair in 2019, leading to further research and professional collaborations. He continues to work on scaling his technology, seeking partnerships with environmental agencies and NGOs to implement pilot projects around the world, especially in regions heavily affected by plastic waste pollution.</p>
  
  <h2>Notable works and projects</h2>
  <p>Fionn Ferreira's most notable contribution is the development of a magnetic separation method for microplastics, which combines magnets and light-based sensors to efficiently detect and remove pollutants. He has also authored papers on environmental contamination and sustainable water management and advocates for increased awareness of marine pollution issues. His ongoing projects involve designing portable water purification systems suitable for use in affected communities and ecosystems.</p>
  
  <h2>Personal life</h2>
  <p>Ferreira prefers to keep his personal life private but has expressed a keen passion for environmental activism and technology development. He is an avid hiker and enjoys exploring Ireland's natural landscapes. Ferreira often collaborates with youth environmental initiatives and mentors young scientists interested in sustainability and clean tech innovations.</p>
  
  <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
  <p>Since his breakthrough, Ferreira has received numerous accolades, including the Google Science Fair Grand Prize (2019), the European Young Innovator Award (2020), and recognition from environmental organizations such as the United Nations Environment Programme. His work has been featured in international media, bringing attention to innovative solutions for water pollution.</p>
  
  <h2>Legacy and impact</h2>
