  <p>Bjarne Stroustrup is a Danish-American computer scientist best known for creating the C++ programming language, which has become one of the most widely used languages for software development. His work has significantly influenced modern programming, combining performance and low-level system access with high-level abstractions essential for large-scale software systems. Throughout his career, he has contributed to the advancement of software engineering, designed numerous language features, and authored influential publications on programming languages.</p>
  
  <h2>Early life and education</h2>
  <p>Born in Flensburg, Germany, shortly after his family moved from Denmark, Bjarne Stroustrup was raised in Denmark. He developed an early interest in mathematics and computers. He earned a Master of Science degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Aarhus University in Denmark, followed by a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge. His educational background laid a strong foundation for his future work in programming language design.</p>
  
  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>Stroustrup began his research career at Bell Labs in New Jersey in the late 1970s, where he started developing the C++ language, initially called "C with Classes." The language aimed to extend C by adding object-oriented features suitable for large-scale software. His work culminated in the release of C++ in 1985, which rapidly gained popularity among programmers. Over the years, he continued to refine and evolve the language, overseeing multiple standards and revisions. Stroustrup's contributions have extended beyond language design into teaching, writing influential books, and speaking at numerous technology conferences worldwide.</p>
  
  <h2>Notable works and projects</h2>
  <p>His principal work, "The C++ Programming Language," first published in 1985, is a comprehensive reference that has become a cornerstone for programmers learning or working with C++. He also authored "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++," aimed at beginners. His research and development efforts include the design of key features of C++, such as classes, inheritance, and templates. Stroustrup has also contributed to discussions on software development best practices and the future of programming languages.</p>
  
  <h2>Personal life</h2>
  <p>Bjarne Stroustrup is known for his modest and focused demeanor, emphasizing the importance of clarity and practicality in software engineering. He is married and has children. Outside of his professional work, he enjoys classical music and traditional Danish cuisine. He has held academic positions at institutions such as Texas A&M University and Columbia University while maintaining his research affiliation with TEXAS A&M and technology companies worldwide.</p>
  
  <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
  <p>Stroustrup has received numerous awards, including the IEEE Computer Society Max Hoffman Award, the Grace Murray Hopper Award, and the IEEE John von Neumann Medal. His contributions have been recognized globally, reflecting his influence on computer science and software development. In 2018, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>
  
  <h2>Legacy and impact</h2>
  <p>As creator of C++, Stroustrup’s work has shaped modern software engineering practices. His language's efficiency, flexibility, and support for object-oriented programming have made it the backbone of countless software systems, embedded systems, and high-performance applications. His advocacy for better programming language design has influenced language development across the industry. Many researchers and programmers regard him as one of the most influential figures in computer science of his generation.</p>
