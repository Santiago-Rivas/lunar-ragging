  <p>Pardis Sabeti is an influential American-Iranian scientist renowned for her pioneering research in genetics and computational biology. She works at Harvard University as a professor and principal investigator, focusing on human genetic variation, infectious diseases, and the evolution of pathogens. Her work has significantly advanced understanding of how humans adapt to different environments and fight off emerging infectious threats.</p>
  
  <h2>Early life and education</h2>
  <p>Sabeti was born in Tehran, Iran, and emigrated with her family to the United States during her childhood. She showed early aptitude in science and mathematics, which led her to study at Harvard University, where she earned her bachelor’s degree in neuroscience and later completed her Ph.D. in computational biology at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. Her diverse educational background laid the foundation for her interdisciplinary approach to research.</p>
  
  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>Throughout her career, Sabeti has contributed to understanding how human populations have evolved by analyzing genetic data from various global populations. She has developed groundbreaking techniques to detect signals of natural selection and adaptation in the human genome. Her research team played a key role in sequencing the Ebola virus genome during the 2014 outbreak, enabling better tracking of the virus’s mutations and spread. She has also been involved in efforts to combat other diseases such as Lassa fever and COVID-19, integrating genomic data with public health responses.</p>
  
  <h2>Notable works and projects</h2>
  <p>Sabeti’s research has led to notable discoveries about human resilience and adaptation, including genetic factors involved in immune responses and resistance to infectious diseases. She helped establish large-scale genomic initiatives and worked on the development of portable DNA sequencing technologies for field diagnostics. Her work not only advances science but also informs public health strategies, particularly in resource-limited settings where rapid detection of outbreaks can save lives.</p>
  
  <h2>Personal life</h2>
  <p>Sabeti is known for her dedication to science and mentorship. She balances her professional commitments with her interests in advocacy for science education, especially within underrepresented communities. Although private about her personal life, she is recognized for inspiring a new generation of scientists, particularly women and minorities in STEM fields.</p>
  
  <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
  <p>She has received numerous accolades including the MacArthur Fellowship ("Genius Grant"), the NIH Director’s Pioneer Award, and election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Her research contributions have been recognized internationally, emphasizing her role as a leader in genetics and infectious disease research.</p>
  
  <h2>Legacy and impact</h2>
  <p>Sabeti’s interdisciplinary approach has transformed how scientists study human evolution and disease. Her innovations in genomic technologies have improved pathogen surveillance and outbreak response, impacting global health strategies.
