  <p>John Bannister Goodenough (born 25 July 1922) was an influential American physicist and materials scientist best known for his pioneering work in the development of lithium-ion battery cathodes. His research contributed significantly to portable electronics, renewable energy storage, and electric vehicles, making him a key figure in modern energy technology. Throughout his career, he received numerous awards for his contributions to science and engineering, spanning over seven decades of research and innovation.</p>
  
  <h2>Early life and education</h2>
  <p>Goodenough was born in Sandy, Utah, and grew up in a family with a strong academic background. He earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Utah in 1944, followed by a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Chicago in 1952. His early fascination with matter and energy led him to pursue extensive research in solid-state physics and materials science, areas in which he would later make groundbreaking advancements.</p>
  
  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>Beginning his professional journey in the 1950s, Goodenough held positions at Yale University and the NASA Lewis Laboratory before joining the University of Texas at Austin. However, his most prominent work was carried out during his tenure at the University of Oxford and later at the University of Texas, where he and his team focused on developing new cathode materials for rechargeable batteries. His work on lithium cobalt oxide revolutionized energy storage and enabled the proliferation of portable devices, from smartphones to laptops. His expertise earned him recognition as one of the key contributors to modern battery technology.</p>
  
  <h2>Notable works and projects</h2>
  <p>Goodenough's most notable achievement was the development of the lithium-cobalt-oxide cathode, which paved the way for commercial lithium-ion batteries. This innovation allowed for batteries with higher energy density, longer lifespan, and improved safety. His research also extended to other types of electrode materials and battery chemistries, advancing the field of rechargeable energy storage. His contributions have been integral to the growth of electric vehicles and renewable energy integration, as efficient storage remains a critical challenge in sustainable development.</p>
  
  <h2>Personal life</h2>
  <p>Goodenough was known for his modesty and dedication to science. He was married and had children, balancing family life with a prolific scientific career. Despite his many achievements, he maintained a down-to-earth personality and remained committed to mentoring young scientists and students throughout his lifetime. He continued active research well into his late 90s, exemplifying lifelong passion for discovery.</p>
  
  <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
  <p>Goodenough received numerous prestigious awards, including the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry—shared with M. Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino—for the development of lithium-ion batteries. Other awards include the National Medal of Science (2011), the Draper Medal (2014), and the Wolf Prize in Chemistry (2014). His pioneering work has earned him lifetime recognition as a leading figure in materials science and energy research.</p>
  
  <h2>Legacy and impact</h2>
  <p>Goodenough’s innovations fundamentally transformed portable electronics and renewable energy storage. His development of high-energy cathode materials has enabled the growth of electric vehicles and has had a profound impact on global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. His scientific approach and dedication continue to inspire generations of researchers, and his work remains foundational in energy storage technology. Recognition of his contributions underscores his status as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th and early 21st centuries.</p>
