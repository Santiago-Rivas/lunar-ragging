  <p>Sara Seager is an American astronomer and astrophysicist renowned for her pioneering work in the field of exoplanets. Her research has contributed significantly to the discovery and characterization of planets outside our solar system, and she has been a leading figure in the development of methods to identify potentially habitable worlds. Seager has held positions at institutions such as Harvard University and led several initiatives within NASA, including contributions to space telescope missions focused on exoplanet detection.</p>
  
  <h2>Early life and education</h2>
  <p>Born in Newark, New Jersey, Seager developed an early interest in astronomy and science fiction. She earned her bachelor's degree in physics from Princeton University before completing her Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Her doctoral thesis focused on the atmospheres of extrasolar planets, laying the foundation for her subsequent research career.</p>
  
  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>Seager's career began with research on planetary atmospheres and the detection of exoplanets using methods such as transit photometry and spectroscopy. She became a professor at Harvard University, where she established the Harvard Exoplanet Physics Group. Her work helped develop techniques used in space observatories like Kepler and TESS. She has participated in several NASA missions aimed at discovering Earth-like planets in habitable zones, and her contributions have advanced the understanding of exoplanet atmospheres and potential signs of life.</p>
  
  <h2>Notable works and projects</h2>
  <p>Among her notable contributions is the development of models to analyze exoplanet atmospheric data, aiding in the search for biosignatures. She was also involved in designing the concept for future space telescopes dedicated to directly imaging exoplanets. Her research has resulted in over 150 scientific publications, and she is frequently featured in media discussing the search for extraterrestrial life and habitable worlds. Seager authored the influential textbook "Exoplanets" and has received numerous awards for her groundbreaking contributions.</p>
  
  <h2>Personal life</h2>
  <p>Seager values her privacy but is known to be an advocate for science education and outreach. She has spoken about the importance of inspiring future generations of scientists, especially women in STEM fields. She is married and has children, often emphasizing the importance of balancing professional pursuits with family life.</p>
  
  <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
  <p>Seager has received multiple awards, including the Kavli Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, the MacArthur Fellowship (commonly known as a "genius grant"), and the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics. She was also named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people and received awards from professional societies such as the American Astronomical Society. Her research has profoundly influenced the modern study of exoplanets and the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>
  
  <h2>Legacy and impact</h2>
  <p>Seager's work has helped define the modern field of exoplanet science, paving the way for future discoveries of potentially habitable planets. Her research methodologies are now standard in many space observatories' workflows. As a prominent female scientist in astrophysics, she serves as an inspiration to many aspiring scientists worldwide, promoting diversity and inclusion in STEM disciplines.</p>
