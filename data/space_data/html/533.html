  <p>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee, born on 8 June 1955 in London, is a British computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. His development of the HTTP protocol, HTML markup language, and the first web browser and server revolutionized information sharing and communication globally, laying the foundation for the modern internet. Berners-Lee’s work has earned him numerous accolades and recognition for transforming technology and society.</p>

  <h2>Early life and education</h2>
  <p>Berners-Lee was raised in a family of engineers; his father was a computer scientist and mathematician, and his mother was a professional mathematician. He attended Queen's College London and later studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he earned a degree in physics in 1976. During his university years, he developed an interest in computer programming and networks, which set the stage for his future innovations.</p>

  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>In the early 1980s, Berners-Lee was working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, where he proposed a system of hypertext to facilitate information sharing among scientists. In 1989, he wrote the first proposal for the World Wide Web and, by 1990, had developed the first web browser and server software. His innovative ideas led to the public release of the web technologies, which rapidly grew into the global platform that underpins today’s digital world.</p>

  <h2>Notable works and projects</h2>
  <p>Berners-Lee created the fundamental technologies of the web, including the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and Uniform Resource Locator (URL). In 1991, he launched the first website at CERN, describing the web and how to use it. In 2009, he launched the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which develops protocols and standards for the ongoing growth and evolution of the web. He has been active in advocating for an open, accessible internet and addressing issues like net neutrality and digital privacy.</p>

  <h2>Personal life</h2>
  <p>Berners-Lee is married and has four children. He has been recognized for his dedication to the open web and digital rights. Known for his modest lifestyle and commitment to public service, he has received various humanitarian awards and honors. He remains actively engaged with web standards development and advocates for a more inclusive and equitable internet society.</p>

  <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
  <p>Berners-Lee has received numerous awards, including a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in 2004, the Millennium Technology Prize in 2013, and the Turing Award in 2016 for his invention of the web. He has been listed among Time magazine’s 100 most influential people and received the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering in 2013. His contributions have been widely acknowledged as transformative for society and technology.</p>

  <h2>Legacy and impact</h2>
  <p>As the inventor of the web, Berners-Lee fundamentally changed the way humans communicate, learn, and conduct business. His creation has fostered unprecedented levels of connectivity, innovation, and access to information. He continues to advocate for an open and accessible internet, emphasizing the importance of digital rights, privacy, and net neutrality. His work has inspired countless developers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers to shape the future of the digital age.</p>
