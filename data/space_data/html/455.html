  <p>Hugh David Herr is an American roboticist and biophysicist known for his pioneering work in prosthetic limb technology and wearable robotics. His research focuses on developing innovative, biologically inspired systems to improve mobility and restore function to individuals with limb loss. Herr has received widespread recognition for integrating engineering, biomechanics, and neuroscience to create advanced prosthetic devices and exoskeletons, positioning him as a leader in the field of bionics.</p>

  <h2>Early life and education</h2>
  <p>Born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Herr developed an interest in outdoor activities and climbing during his youth. At age 17, he experienced a severe climbing accident that resulted in the loss of both legs below the knees. This personal experience with limb loss motivated his subsequent pursuit of engineering solutions to improve mobility. He earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Stanford University and a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering from Harvard University, where his research focused on biomechanics and neural engineering.</p>

  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>Herr joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the 1990s, where he became a prominent researcher in the Department of Media Arts and Sciences at the MIT Media Lab. He pioneered the development of powered prosthetic limbs and exoskeletons that integrate sensors and intelligent control systems to mimic natural movement. His work has led to several innovative devices, including the biocentric prosthetic ankle and powered knee joints, significantly enhancing the mobility and independence of users. His research continues to push the boundaries of wearable robotics and neurotechnology, aiming to bridge the gap between human biology and machine design.</p>

  <h2>Notable works and projects</h2>
  <p>Herr’s notable projects include the development of adaptive prosthetic limbs capable of adjusting to different terrains and activities. He led the design of the "Biomimetic Robotics" projects at MIT, which seek to emulate biological structures using robotic systems. His team also developed neural interface techniques enabling direct control of prosthetic devices via brain signals. These innovations aim to restore a natural gait and perception of movement for amputees and individuals with mobility impairments. Herr's research has received numerous awards, including the National Medal of Technology and Innovation and membership in the National Academy of Engineering.</p>

  <h2>Personal life</h2>
  <p>Hugh Herr is known for his advocacy in disability rights and his passion for climbing and outdoor activities. Despite the physical challenges resulting from his accident, he remains active in mountaineering and adventure sports, inspiring others with his resilience. Herr has spoken extensively on the potential of robotic technologies to enhance human capabilities and improve quality of life. He is married and resides in the Boston area, where he continues his research and teaching at MIT.</p>

  <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
  <p>Herr has received numerous accolades, including the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2016 for his contributions to bionics and prosthetics. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. His work has been featured in media outlets such as The New York Times, Scientific American, and TED Talks, where he discusses the future of human augmentation and assistive technology.</p>

  <h2>Legacy and impact</h2>
  <p>Herr’s innovations have transformed the field of prosthetics and wearable robotics, enabling users to regain mobility with natural movement and sensation. His interdisciplinary approach has influenced advancements in neuroscience, engineering, and assistive technology, inspiring a new generation of researchers and entrepreneurs. His vision of enhancing human potential through technology continues to shape the future of bionics and bioengineering, promoting an inclusive approach to mobility and rehabilitation.</p>
