  <p>Tu Youyou is a Chinese pharmacologist and Nobel laureate recognized for her groundbreaking discovery of artemisinin, a compound that has significantly advanced the treatment of malaria. Her innovative research in traditional Chinese medicine and her contributions to global health have earned her international acclaim. Her work has saved millions of lives worldwide and transformed the landscape of infectious disease pharmacology.</p>

  <h2>Early life and education</h2>
  <p>Born in Jiangxi Province in 1930, Tu Youyou studied pharmacology at Peking University and later joined China's Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. During her education, she developed an interest in traditional Chinese medicine and herbal remedies. Her dedication and curiosity led her to investigate ancient texts and explore traditional formulations for modern medical applications.</p>

  <h2>Career</h2>
  <p>Tu Youyou began her research in the 1950s and 1960s, focusing on finding effective treatments for malaria during the Vietnam War. She led a secret project to identify plant-based compounds capable of combating the disease. After extensive screening and research, she isolated artemisinin (also known as qinghao or sweet wormwood extract) in 1972. Her discovery proved highly effective against Plasmodium falciparum, including drug-resistant strains, leading to a new standard in malaria therapy.</p>

  <h2>Notable works and projects</h2>
  <p>Her work on artemisinin and its derivatives has transformed malaria treatment worldwide. The development of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) has greatly reduced mortality rates. Tu's research integrated traditional Chinese medicine with modern pharmacological techniques. Her approach combined ethnopharmacology with rigorous scientific validation, paving the way for novel drug discovery from traditional remedies.</p>

  <h2>Personal life</h2>
  <p>Tu Youyou is known to be a private individual. She has dedicated much of her life to scientific research and academic pursuits. Despite her fame, she remains modest and focused on her contributions to medicine and science. She is deeply respected within the scientific community for her perseverance and integrity.</p>

  <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
  <p>In 2015, Tu Youyou was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, sharing the honor with William C. Campbell and Satoshi Omura. She was the first Chinese woman to win a Nobel in a scientific category. Her recognition also includes the State Supreme Science and Technology Prize and numerous national honours in China. Her discovery remains a cornerstone of anti-malarial drug development.</p>

  <h2>Legacy and impact</h2>
  <p>Tu Youyou's discovery has had a profound impact on global health, especially in malaria-endemic regions. Her ability to bridge traditional Chinese medicine with modern pharmacology has inspired many researchers worldwide. Her work has saved millions of lives and provided a model for drug discovery rooted in ethnobotanical knowledge. Her legacy continues through ongoing research and development in infectious disease control and pharmacognosy.</p>
