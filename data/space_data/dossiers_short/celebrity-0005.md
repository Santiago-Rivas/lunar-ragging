### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** Mae Jemison

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Houston, TX; maintains studio-loft office in New York’s Harlem for education initiatives  
- Quarterly travel loop: Washington DC (policy), Nairobi (STEM program), San Francisco & Los Angeles (start-up boards)

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & President, The Jemison Group and 100 Year Starship (DARPA-seeded)  
- Former NASA astronaut, STS-47 mission specialist; physician & chemical engineer  
- Board director: Vantage Bio-Systems (microgravity tissue printing), Planetary Culture Lab

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Leading a $40 M public–private consortium to test closed-loop life-support bioreactors on a 2026 commercial LEO flight  
- Scaling “Look Up™” global STEAM challenge to reach 10 million students by 2027  
- Authoring “Cultural Design for Interstellar Civility,” blending anthropology with mission architecture  
- Personally exploring dance-based VR training protocols for vestibular adaptation in lunar gravity

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong modern dancer; choreographs a new piece each year—still rehearses 3 times weekly  
- Collects traditional masks from diaspora communities; uses them to discuss identity in spacefaring societies  
- Favorite maxim: “Independence requires interdependence” (drawn from West African philosophy)  
- Weekend passion: experimenting with hydroponic spicy greens—claims arugula flavor intensifies in partial gravity simulations

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Only attendee who has already eaten in microgravity; invaluable first-hand tips on taste perception and menu design  
- Aims to explore partnership opportunities for embedding STEAM storytelling into Planta’s future off-world experiences  
- Curious about behavioral data from Planta’s social-connectivity platform—wants to study cohesion in isolated groups  
- Offers compelling keynote sound-bite potential on “bridging the mundane and the cosmic over a shared meal”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- Warm intros desired to:  
  • Artemis Base Camp life-support leads (NASA Johnson)  
  • SoftBank Vision Fund climate-tech team for bio-reactor scale-up  
  • Culinary innovator José Andrés (World Central Kitchen) on space-relief logistics  
- Can mentor early-stage founders in biotech, ed-tech, and cross-cultural design  
- Engaging approach: reference her college dance days or ask how choreography informs mission planning

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Unusual fact prompt: She once co-starred on Star Trek: The Next Generation and still keeps a phaser on her office shelf—great ice-breaker.  
- Prefers candid, curiosity-driven dialogue; disengages when conversations focus solely on “first woman” narratives—shift toward future impact.  
- Follow-up queries: status of 2026 LEO bioreactor payload manifest; interest in curating a post-event student challenge “Recipes for the Moon.”
