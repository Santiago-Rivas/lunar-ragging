### CONFIDENTIAL DOSSIER: The First Dinner Party on the Moon

**FULL NAME:** PROF. JENNIFER A. DOUDNA, Ph.D

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary base: Berkeley, California (UC Berkeley & Innovative Genomics Institute headquarters)
- Secondary hubs: Boston/Cambridge for board meetings; Geneva & Singapore for ethics councils
- Typical travel cadence: 10–12 international trips per year, favoring red-eye flights to preserve lab time

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Professor of Chemistry & Molecular Biology, UC Berkeley; Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2020 for CRISPR-Cas9
- Co-founder/board member: Mammoth Biosciences, Caribou Biosciences, Scribe Therapeutics, Arc Institute
- Key achievements
  • Pioneered CRISPR diagnostics deployed in 32 countries during COVID-19  
  • Architect of the IGI “Transparent Licensing” framework now adopted by 80+ universities  
  • Led international moratorium that reframed guidelines on human germline editing

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Advancing first-in-human CRISPR sickle-cell cure—Phase II trials start Q4 2025
- Building a $200 M biofoundry for pandemic-grade mRNA and in-field CRISPR diagnostics
- Launching “Resilient Crops Initiative” to gene-edit drought-tolerant wheat for sub-Saharan Africa
- Personal: finishing a narrative-style book on scientific serendipity; carving weekly ocean-surf sessions to reset focus

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Lifelong surfer and certified scuba diver; claims wave patterns help her solve protein-folding puzzles
- Collects volcanic rocks from observatories worldwide; childhood in Hilo, Hawaiʻi fuels fascination with lunar basalt
- Guiding philosophy: “Precision without purpose is noise—science must answer a human need.”
- Evening hobby: plays mellow ukulele sets at small gatherings, rarely publicized

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Relevance: CRISPR-enabled microbes for closed-loop life-support, carbon recycling, and lunar agriculture
- Seeking dialogue on how microgravity alters DNA-repair pathways—data needed for human adaptation to deep-space travel
- Would welcome partners for a micro-CRISPR lab module on the next commercial lunar mission
- Brings authority on bioethics and policy framing; can anchor a rapid-fire salon on “Responsible Innovation Off-Earth”

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: NASA Space Biology Program, SpaceX Starship Life-Support team, Celesta Capital’s deep-tech fund
- Helpful resources: lunar regolith simulants for CRISPR-grown plants; access to continuous microgravity platforms
- Engaging approach: open with an unexpected parallel between surfing swells and orbital mechanics—she lights up

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Prefers data-rich, no-hype exchanges; gently deflects “designer baby” sensationalism
- Dietary alert: severe shellfish allergy—confirm menu adaptations for lunar dinner
- Surprising prompt aligned with host goal: ask what rare Hawaiian sea creature she once CRISPR-tagged for fluorescence
- Follow-up queries: interest in co-authoring a “Space Bioethics” white paper; potential keynote slot at Planta Network’s Earth-based summit 2028
