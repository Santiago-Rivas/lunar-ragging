**FULL NAME:** Whitney Wolfe Herd

---
### IDENTITY & BASE
- Primary residence: Austin, TX; maintains apartments in London and New York for investor relations & policy work  
- Quarterly travel loop: EU policy hubs (Brussels, Berlin), Southeast Asia growth markets, West Coast tech corridor  
- Routinely schedules “digital detox” retreats—three-day blocks with no devices except a Sony A1 camera for creative resets  

### PROFESSIONAL OVERVIEW
- Founder & Chair, Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ: BMBL) — now a four-app portfolio spanning dating, friendship, professional networking, and group travel  
- Steering BumbleX, an immersive mixed-reality platform targeting Gen Z social discovery; pilot launched Q1 2025  
- Board seats: Daily Harvest, Bitwise Industries; UN Women Global Innovation Coalition advisor  

### CURRENT PRIORITIES
- Closing a $600 M sustainability-linked credit facility to fund BumbleX expansion and carbon-negative data centers  
- Building an AI “Wingwoman” safety layer—on-device LLM that flags harassment in real time; beta results to be published late 2025  
- Personally curating a $50 M impact fund backing women-led climate tech; first cheque into lunar-ag tech startup Lunaria Farms  
- Preparing memoir-plus-playbook “Swipe Right on Power” (Penguin, 2026) — positioning as manifesto for empathetic leadership  

### INTERESTS & INSIGHTS
- Passionate collector of mid-century space-race memorabilia; owns an original 1969 LIFE magazine signed by Sally Ride  
- Practices freediving; says the breath-holding discipline “recalibrates leadership stress tolerance”  
- Guiding credo: “Design the table so everyone gets a seat, then light it beautifully.”  

### EVENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
- Sees the lunar dinner as a living lab for “borderless intimacy” — testing how human connection adapts to micro-gravity and distance  
- Wants candid input on integrating haptic feedback and bio-metrics into BumbleX for off-planet use cases  
- Brings expertise in crafting psychologically safe digital spaces; can advise Planta Network on consent-centric interaction protocols  

### NETWORKING & OPPORTUNITIES
- High-value intros: SpaceX Starlink social product team lead, ESA Chief Psychologist, Patagonia’s VP of Regenerative Ops (for climate fund co-invest)  
- Attendees could help by sharing VR/AR hardware roadmaps, neuro-interface research, and lunar habitat behavioral data  
- Engagement tip: Ask about her grandfather’s Apollo-era engineering notebooks—she carries scanned pages on her phone and lights up when sharing them  

### ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Sensitive: Avoid referencing past litigation with Tinder; conversation energy drops when revisiting that chapter  
- Prefers quick, insight-rich exchanges; follow up with one crisp action item within 24 hours  
- Future deep-dive: explore joint scholarship program for women in astro-psychology—a concept she’s been sketching but hasn’t yet socialized.
